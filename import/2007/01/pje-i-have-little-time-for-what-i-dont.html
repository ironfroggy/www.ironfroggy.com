Phillip J. <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Eby</span>, I have a lot of respect for a lot of the things you right, including most of <a href="http://dirtsimple.org/">your</a> <a href="http://dirtsimple.org/2007/01/where-zope-leads-python-follows.html">recent</a> <a href="http://dirtsimple.org/2007/01/zope-haters-prove-my-point-about-women.html">posts</a>. Dimwits refuse to learn, assholes yell at you for suggesting it, and good developers can acknowledge and embrace their faults and <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">ignorance</span>. No matter how much I learn I never want to think I have nothing left worth learning.<br /><br />There are a lot of technologies and solutions I do not use. I'm sure all of them have their good points and their bad points, <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Zope</span> included. However, I probably won't ever get to know much or anything about them. The time to familiarize myself in any valuable degree with <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Zope</span>, <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Django</span>, <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Turbogears</span>, and mod_python is simply more than I have after using the solutions I actually apply to real usage.<br /><br />Besides the things I can't find time to learn, even if I know they probably have really interesting aspects, there are <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">definitely</span> things I just won't learn or won't learn any more of. <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">PHP</span> is a good example, and many people know just how I <a href="http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2006/09/but-didnt-php-break-web-in-first-place.html">feel</a> about that. Yes, I might fit some of the descriptions <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">PJE</span> defined for people he would not hire. Asked about my worst experiences, I would likely bring up <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">PHP</span> and I don't believe I could have anything good to say about it. Is that ignorant of me, or is it just that bad? Maybe I just saw the limitations and before I learned real merits of the system, I moved on. <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">Regardless</span>, I've not locked myself into having no good answer for the interview question!<br /><br />Never stop learning is a great rule to live by, but it doesn't mean you can't stop learning about particular things you deem <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">invaluable</span> to your <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">precious</span> time.
