Phillip J. Eby, I have a lot of respect for a lot of the things you
right, including most of `your <http://dirtsimple.org/>`__
`recent <http://dirtsimple.org/2007/01/where-zope-leads-python-follows.html>`__

Dimwits refuse to learn, assholes yell at you for suggesting it, and
good developers can acknowledge and embrace their faults and ignorance.
No matter how much I learn I never want to think I have nothing left
worth learning.
There are a lot of technologies and solutions I do not use. I'm sure all
of them have their good points and their bad points, Zope included.
However, I probably won't ever get to know much or anything about them.
The time to familiarize myself in any valuable degree with Zope, Django,
Turbogears, and mod_python is simply more than I have after using the
solutions I actually apply to real usage.
Besides the things I can't find time to learn, even if I know they
probably have really interesting aspects, there are definitely things I
just won't learn or won't learn any more of. PHP is a good example, and
many people know just how I
`feel <http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2006/09/but-didnt-php-break-web-in-first-place.html>`__
about that. Yes, I might fit some of the descriptions PJE defined for
people he would not hire. Asked about my worst experiences, I would
likely bring up PHP and I don't believe I could have anything good to
say about it. Is that ignorant of me, or is it just that bad? Maybe I
just saw the limitations and before I learned real merits of the system,
I moved on. Regardless, I've not locked myself into having no good
answer for the interview question!
Never stop learning is a great rule to live by, but it doesn't mean you
can't stop learning about particular things you deem invaluable to your
precious time.
