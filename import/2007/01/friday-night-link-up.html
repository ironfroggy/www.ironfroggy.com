The Tiger Woods title looks absolutely fantastic and I've never been a fan of golf or golf video games, but I'll pick this title up on launch day.</li><li class="post" key="e759a14b1038b2c9a711de9126f1d349">  <h4 class="desc"><a href="http://www.wiicade.com/Home.aspx" rel="nofollow">WiiCade.com - Flash Games on your Nintendo Wii</a>  </h4>I had hoped someone would do this.

Web apps become more and more widespread and even with the proliferation of always-on connections, we can't forget that things need to work when the network fails, I'm working off solar panels in the mountains, or the world has ended and only patches of ad-hoc networks survive.<br /><br />The idea is to enable web applications that can cache lots of data for offline use. I used to abuse Google Reader to do this before the long drives to and from North Carolina, by scrolling across all my hundreds of unread items they would all be downloaded internally and then even offline I would be able to read through them. This kind of functionality needs to be empowered, not accidental.<br /></li><li class="post" key="da3a180d3e9c840325ff107c67ea2353">  <h4 class="desc"><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/firefox_3_plans.php" rel="nofollow" name="item6">Firefox 3 Plans and IE8 Speculation - Browsers Heading Apart Again</a>  </h4>I am more interested in how far Firefox 4 will go to providing a unique platform for web applications.

Does it point to a larger problem that one of the most important technological minds of our era can only solve the problem by just locking everyone out?<br /></li></ol>
