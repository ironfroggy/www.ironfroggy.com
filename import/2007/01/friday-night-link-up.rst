   Creates a python-style C++. This replaces {} with indentation and
   removes excess parenthesis. Its definately a very interesting
   project, but how many uses it sees I am not sure of.

   One of my favorite games on the Wii has been the golf of WiiSports,
   but it is very limited and toyish, as fun as it is. The Tiger Woods
   title looks absolutely fantastic and I've never been a fan of golf or
   golf video games, but I'll pick this title up on launch day.

   I had hoped someone would do this. Bookmark the website on your Wii
   and get quick access to lots of web-based flash and java games that
   are friendly to being played via the Wii and Wiimote.

   There really isn't much more that I can say about this after the
   title. He even sets fire to things with his fingertips, and does this
   on a regular basis!

   | This is a great idea that needs explored more thoroughly. Web apps
     become more and more widespread and even with the proliferation of
     always-on connections, we can't forget that things need to work
     when the network fails, I'm working off solar panels in the
     mountains, or the world has ended and only patches of ad-hoc
     networks survive.
   | The idea is to enable web applications that can cache lots of data
     for offline use. I used to abuse Google Reader to do this before
     the long drives to and from North Carolina, by scrolling across all
     my hundreds of unread items they would all be downloaded internally
     and then even offline I would be able to read through them. This
     kind of functionality needs to be empowered, not accidental.

   | I am more interested in how far Firefox 4 will go to providing a
     unique platform for web applications. Will we open up the embedded
     SQLite database to javascript in the pages, or bind OpenGL for
     accelerated rendering into canvas elements?

   | I was going to write about how Steve Jobs is a moron because of the
     whole "no third party software" thing on the iPhone, but then I
     realized that I'm sure I would absolutely love the iPhone. Does it
     point to a larger problem that one of the most important
     technological minds of our era can only solve the problem by just
     locking everyone out?
