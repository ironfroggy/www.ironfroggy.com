This is a tale of the worst customer service I have ever been witness to. I am the victim in the story. Were it not for my love of On Demand, I would have been on the phone with DirectTV days ago. I'm still considering, but it depends on some things.<br /><br />All I wanted was High Definition television and a DVR box from my new cable company. Now, for background, I am renting my current house from my mother-in-law, to keep the house for her, while she works a temporary position with her company's training infrastructure. We're trying to keep as much as possible in her name, so that her move back is easier.<br /><br />Here is the tale, in bullet point:<br /><ul><li style="font-weight: bold;">Call and schedule an appointment and backup appointment for HD DVR and a cable modem installation.</li><li>Miss the first appointment and figure they were busy.</li><li>Call first thing on the day of the backup, to remove the cable modem from the order. The phone company gave me a discount to keep the DSL, that saved me more than a bundle from the cable company.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find out they never made the appointment.</span> I waited a week for nothing.</li><li>I ask if I, not being the account holder, can go in and pick up the box. I am told tha I can.</li><li>Going into the location, <span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm told I can't pick up the box,</span> even though I have all the information.</li><li>My wife is added to the account, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">we're told I can pick up the box,</span> being married to an account holder.</li><li>Second trip is responded to negatively. When I say the 800 number OK'ed my trip, I am told "<span style="font-weight: bold;">You don't need to listen to them, you need to listen to me</span>. I have the boxes."</li><li>My wife goes to the location with a friend.</li><li>She's told she is not on the account, but that there is a note that her mother called in to add her. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Somehow, that was not good enough.</span></li><li>"Isn't that good enough," her friend asks.<br />"Who is this," the clerk asks, pointing at the friend and not looking away from my wife. <span style="font-weight: bold;">"She needs to not talk."</span></li><li>On that last point, <span style="font-weight: bold;">I shit you not.</span></li><li>They take my wife into the back office to tell her she can not get the box. That is strange.<br /></li><li>When my wife gets home, I call them again and tell them the story, only to have it confirmed that my wife is absolutely on the account. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Their HQ contacts the retail location and tells the manager to expect us</span> and have the equipment ready.</li><li>We go back, pick up the box, and bring it home.</li><li>They forgot to give us a power cable.</li><li style="font-weight: bold;">We make a fifth trip to get a power cable.</li></ul>No one would tell me how much storage the box had, so I still don't know how much I can record on the thing.
