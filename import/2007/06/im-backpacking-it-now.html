After finally trying to spend some time using <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/">Backpack</a>, to really get an idea of what it is all about, I decided it was to stick with. I was already at the 5 page limit for free accounts, so I went to upgrade to Basic for $5 a month. Thankfully, at the last minute I remembered that 37signals themselves <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/37signals_coupon_codes.php">post coupons</a>. First month is free, so no risk.<br /><br />This also means I can try the calendar service, and have file upload capability. I'm trying out the use of page sharing to coordinate with a client.
