   My back and legs hurt, but this might be a solution: the Stand Up
   Desk. There are different ways to implement this. Some people shell
   out the money for adjustable desks. You could place a shelf with an
   extra monitor and keyboard at standing height and attached to your
   machine with splitters. I'm looking into the kind of adjustable mount
   arm attached to portables in hospitals, to install behind my desk and
   allow my screen and a set of keyboard and mouse to adjust up easily,
   without the rest of the desk needed. I think alternating sitting and
   standing will be nice. Until then, I'll stand up to read.
