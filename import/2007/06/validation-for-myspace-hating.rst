   The hating of MySpace is not unique, but any professional-seeming
   information to back it up is rare. The findings are probably dead on
   with what I would expect, and I don't even see Facebook or know
   anyone on it. I do see the people on MySpace and the kind of people
   that I definitely do not see there. Social classes in the United
   States are always interesting, because there is a different dynamic
   than the expected class lines. Although, income certainly comes into
   play, it is not the definitive factor.
   After reading about the division it reaffirms my desire to use
   Facebook. However, I don't know anyone on Facebook. All of my friends
   are on MySpace, including those running their own businesses, those
   with families, any of the younger members of my family, and the ones
   making far more money than I. The social divisions that mark MySpace
   are also what tie me to it.
