| Feature volume rises as applications and services merge and soon we
  will need the power of Google within single applications. Of course,
  there are reasons for this that lend to the idea that we will not have
  single applications in the future. As applications migrate into
  services, and services combine and interact, the whole of software is
  evolving into a massive software ecosystem. Every state of software
  can be integrate, broadcast, and pull from a host of other global
  services. The number of "features" available at any point is rocketing
  into unimaginable heights. Until we can automate the integration,
  filtering, and aggregation of the mass of services we have for working
  with the same data set, we do not benefit as fully from their
  availability.

| Jeff Atwood `brought this
  up <http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000887.html>`__ in
  context of Office 2007's Ribbon and the Scout plug-in that may not see
  the light of day, for internal political reasons at Redmond. The
  apparent story is that adding a feature to search their interface,
  even optionally, would undermine their attempts at marketing the glory
  that is the Ribbon. Of course, a searchable Ribbon is leagues beyond
  the traditional mess of menus and toolbars. Embrace of this concept
  would do nothing but benefit them, and give a head start in giving
  users a compass to navigate the ocean of features coming to them.
  Usability is about to transform from a gentle drift to a tidal wave.

I want to expand on this, but it is for another post. Features adapt
into web services. Microformats and service discovery replace Plug-in
systems. The interfaces of our applications will become a search engine
of features, contextualized to the present task. When I can gather some
information and thoughts on these subjects, I want to produce something
interesting to gather the ideas into one place.
