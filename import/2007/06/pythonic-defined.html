There are times I do not know what it means, but that doesn't mean I can define a pretty good idea of what "pythonic" really means. Now, it has been defined at times as being whatever the BDFL decides, but we'll pull that out of the picture. I want to talk about what the word means for us today, and how it applied to what we do in the real world.<br /><br />Languages have their strengths and their idioms (ways of doing things), and when you exploit those you embrace the heart of that language. You can often tell when a programmer writing in one language is actually more comfortable with another, because the code they right is telltale of the other language. Java developers are notorious for writing Java in every language they get their hands on. How can you write one language in another? The answer to that is exactly the opposite to understanding what a term like "pythonic" means. A programmer coming to Python from C might write everything in functions, and avoid classes, while a programmer coming from Java might refuse to ever use a function and often wants to create a separate module for <i>every single class</i>. These are the telltale influences of their comfort languages on their Python coding. The situation can occure between any migration between languages. Their following of those languages' idioms when they are writing Python is incorrect, but when writing those languages, it is embracing the language. Doing the same in Python, itself, is Pythonic.<br /><h2>In the Real World</h2>You will not truly understand "pythonic" without seeing it and experiencing it in the real world. You'll know you understand it when you can reliably identify what is <i>not</i> pythonic. However, we can speed up your time to making those judgement calls through examples and talking about what makes them the way they are.<br /><a name="losing"></a><h3>Losing is Good</h3>New comers to the language are often nervous about dynamic typing. Most don't really understand what it means, or why it can be a good thing. The most common new comer thoughts about dynamic typing is that you can assign any type of value to any variable. They like to think of them as void * in C, which is a large mistake. Variables do not change type in Python. Instead, names have no type association at all and the objects they point to (reference) describe their own types. The nervousness and misunderstanding of dynamic typing leads to over-zealous employment of the isinstance() and type() as type checking facilities, even when the code is absolutely, perfectly valid without it.<br /><blockquote><i>If you code is correct if some section is removed, remove the<br />section.</i></blockquote>I think the best example of this has to be the dangerous desire to add, for example, isinstance(x, list) at the beginning of a function that expects an argument x to be a list. The programmer thinks safety has been added, by blocking the function from being called with anything not expected. What was accomplished is making the function slower, more brittle, and less pythonic. No longer can the function type a tuple, the keys of a dictionary, a generator, or an xrange object. New comers are not always aware of those things, or of how its so valuable to use them all interchangeably when the interface you need for each is the same subset: iteration.<br /><br />There are other cases where removing something actually gives you something. Make functions smaller, combine functions that do the same things and are named differently, and turn a class into a function where it does not add any properties or methods, such as a case where all the logic is in the __init__ method. If you are having trouble catching an exception you don't know what to do with, don't catch it at all and let your caller deal with it. One of the best feelings you can get is cutting the lines of code in half, while simultaneously making the code gain new features and more speed.<br /><a name="strings"></a><h3>Strings</h3>Although the string may be the most common kind of data in a programming language, next to the integer, how they are handled between languages varies as wildly as David Hasslehoff's popularity between the States and Germany. A great many constructs with strings are good in one language and absolutely terrible in another. Some times the difference is only visual, and other times it has to do with the very nature of what a string is from language to language.<br /><blockquote><i>Immutable strings referenced by untyped names require completely<br />different semantics than typed languages or those with mutable strings.</i></blockquote>String concatenation, understanding of when to use string formatting, and grasping how string manipulations work are sometimes barriers faced by anyone not familiar with Python. I think we can break down the situation into a small set of rules to live by.<br /><ul><li>Connecting only two strings? Concatenation with the + operator is alright.</li><br /><li>Connecting more than two strings? Use ''.join(iterable_of_strings), because Python can't optimize a chain of + on strings, as it does not know they are strings due to untyped names.</li><br /><li>Are you using an empty string format, such as "%d" or "%r"? Then you are wastefully formatting where a simple call suffices, such as int(s) and repr(s), respectively.</li><br /><li>Are you using a regular expression where the split, strip, or replace methods would suffice? Then do not use the regular expression.</li></ul><a name="dictionaries"></a><h3>Dictionaries</h3><i>Responding to a post at <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2007/06/12/python-dictionaries-are-not-the-same-as-instances/">Blue Sky On Mars</a>, this section has been added to deal with the issue of classes and objects versus dictionaries.</i><br /><br />You'll find dictionaries to be one of the most flexible and powerful concepts in Python. Much of the infrastructure of the language is actually built on top of them. We need to cover when you should use a dictionary and when you should not.<br /><br />A common error of those new to Python and languages with proper hash tables is to really over use when they are applied directly. People from C draw an obvious connection between a dictionary and a struct, and it makes sense. However, the connection only lasts for as long as its not applied as widespread as a struct is in C code. Dictionaries as general data structures are actually a very non-pythonic thing to do, despite the pythonic nature of dictionaries themselves. Python provides a rich, featureful object and class system, so abusing dictionaries is only lessening what power you have at your finger tips.<br /><ul><li>Type less.<br />enemy.health is better than enemy["health"]<br />enemy = Enemy(100, 50, 30) is better than enemy = {"health": 100, "attack": 50, "defense": 30}</li><li>Add methods, now or later.<br />enemy.hit(player) is better than hit(enemy, player)</li><li>Default values, lazy computed values, and deprecation of values is not possible in a dictionary.<br /></li></ul><a name="conclusion"></a><h2>Time is Your Teacher</h2>Nothing is going to teach you how to understand the real meaning of "pythonic" without experience and a lot of exposure to all kinds of Python code. Your best measure of your understanding of the concept is surely how well you can spot that code which is <i>not</i> pythonic, rather than that code which is. Code will begin to smell bad, and code smell is one of your most powerful tools as a developer, and one of the only tools, which can not be taught.<br /><br />Patience is your key.
