After finally trying to spend some time using
`Backpack <http://www.backpackit.com/>`__, to really get an idea of what
it is all about, I decided it was to stick with. I was already at the 5
page limit for free accounts, so I went to upgrade to Basic for $5 a
month. Thankfully, at the last minute I remembered that 37signals
themselves `post
coupons <http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/37signals_coupon_codes.php>`__.
First month is free, so no risk.
This also means I can try the calendar service, and have file upload
capability. I'm trying out the use of page sharing to coordinate with a
client.
