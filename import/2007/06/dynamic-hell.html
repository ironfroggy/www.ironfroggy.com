There is a question I often see from Python newbies: How to use the contents of a string as a variable name. In other words, to dynamically create a variable based on some runtime-found name. A lot of these users come from more static backgrounds and have heard the benefits of dynamic languages. I have to wonder if these are signs of their over-eagerness to exploit that dynamic nature.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">exec "%s = %d" % (raw_input(), input())<br /></span><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size:85%;">Example of dynamic variable names in action. To a pythoner, obviously not pythonic.<br /></span></span></div><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">d = {}<br />d[raw_input()] = int(raw_input())<br /></span><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: courier new;"></span><span style="font-size:78%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Less bad. This is why dictionaries exist, so we use them. Also, we remove the potentially dangerous and frivolous use of input() in favor of int(raw_input()).</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;"></span></div><br />There are a lot of things that different programming languages are good for and things they are bad for. There are times when their negative points can be exploited, of course. There are far more times when their positive points can be exploited, and turned into disaster. Pointers in C, for example, are useful in the cases where they are used properly and smartly, but terrible when wielded by the wrong hand with evil or ignorant intent. The same can be true for a lot of a dynamic language's features.<br /><br />People trying to avoid knowing the names and number of variables they have, create classes on the fly with runtime information, and build and evaluate python code in strings are looking at the flexibility of the language and really want to use that for their own good. The problem is that great power requires great responsibility, as we all know. What most of us don't realize, is that great responsibility requires great wisdom, and we can't buy, read, or request on IRC for wisdom. That means the great power that lures these new comers to the language is inevitably what will always keep them from fully experiencing the gifts it bestows. This is not a flaw or a unique attribute of the language, of any language, or of anything at all which benefits mankind and requires knowledge. Just don't exert yourself. Don't do anything for the sake of paradigms or languages or buzzwords. Solutions are neutral, so solve them for solution's sake, not implementation's sake.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">[foo() for i in range(10)]</span><br /><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size:78%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">An obvious abuse of a list comprehension as a for loop one-liner.

If they want dynamic variable names, we tell them to use a dictionary; they complain about the inefficiency of hash table lookups versus variable names (from a C perspective, often). The simple thing I cannot understand with this is how they expect the dynamic variables work, if not a hash table. If they think they work like C stack locals, yet can be dynamic, why would they think that magical technique would not be applied to dictionaries. In other words, if they recognize they achieve the same end, why do they think they are such wildly different routes?<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Update: I added some examples the day after initially posting this.</span><br /><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"><br /></script>
