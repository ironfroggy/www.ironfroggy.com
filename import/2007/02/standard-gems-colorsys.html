Lots of us do color work. Maybe you're writing a full-fledged Photoshop killer, or you just want a utility to do some bulk conversions or color scheme generations. Well, in any case, you might find the often-forgotten colorsys module handy.<br /><br />You can easily convert between different color component systems with these included functions:<br /><br />hls_to_rgb(h, l, s)<br />hsv_to_rgb(h, s, v)<br />rgb_to_hls(r, g, b)<br />rgb_to_hsv(r, g, b)<br />rgb_to_yiq(r, g, b)<br />yiq_to_rgb(y, i, q)
