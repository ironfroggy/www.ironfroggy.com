Developers are opinionated people. There are issues in our line of work
with very bold lines between one side and the next, arguing over this
point and that. I will not debate if emacs or vim is the superior
editor, but I'm going to take a look at some important issues from the
extreme lines, from the far polarized groups that chant all-or-nothing
for their answer, from the points
of view where the distractions of opposition won't lead us astray. This
is not to say I agree with either side, as I will try to look at them
both, separately, but that I think looking at some issues, temporarily,
in with a few doors shut is a good way to get the full view of that
aspect.
I'll be sure to disclose my personal preferences, but I want to be as
neutral in the matters as I can be.
This series will be called "Extreme Code" because of the "extreme" views
we'll examine on each of the issues. The first edition will be published
tomorrow, and is entitled "Extreme Code - Version Control For One File"
