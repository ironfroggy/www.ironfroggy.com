<h1>Extreme Code - Version Control For One File</h1><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">You should start using version control systems when you only have a single file.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"> <br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> You don't need a version control system until you have a large project and lots of collaborators.</span><br> <br> Two statements I've heard from individuals of great caliber, and it carried weight coming from individuals on both sides. Version control is important, and no developer worth their weight in USB keys will tell you to never user a VCS, but exactly when and where and why you should use them is not so agreed upon. The differences in opinion come from cultural, experience, and industry reasons. Many members of the free software community seem more exposed and ready to use CVS or Subversion, where version control is almost impossible to avoid when you need to collaborate across the world. Some individuals have horror stories about projects without version control, and others have never seen practical benefit in their time as developers. Yet, some simply work in areas of the industry that have less call, or less cultural motivation. Web designers rarely version control HTML and stylesheets, and game developers have a short code life cycle to begin with. Can we find the happy middle ground between always using version control and avoiding it like a ten ton plague? If we look at it from the two extremes, we just might.<br> <br><h2> Extremely Using Version Control</h2> <br> You should create the repository to track and house your files before you even create the first file. There isn't any reason to wait, and you'll see the benefits immediately. The extra time spent creating the repository and tracking changesets when you only have a handful of files is still worth the benefit, because the benefit is not reduced in proportion to the number of files or the number of developers. You can have a small, single file and a single developer, and you'll still be better off with a VCS than without, I guarantee it!<br> <br> The use of a repository isn't a passive act. You can't just record a changeset when you feel like it, and treat the repository like a second-class tool. Committing is not what you do when the code seems OK, its something you plan ahead for and plan your work around. From an untouched state, you decide your plan of attack on a problem and work on that, and only that. When you record the changes, you need to be able to attribute them to a particular goal, to have the repository in a valid state with a logical progression. Before the patch, some bug existed, and after the patch, this bug was resolved. This is clear, logical, linear, and how the repository helps both remind you of the past and guide you to the future.<br><br>As a single developer, you have just as much reason to make full use of version control as a team of hundreds of developers. The structure it gives you will lend well to your progression and not becoming lost in a sea of changing code. If among a hundred programmers, a mistake can be made and rollbacks or history needed, then a single programmer without peer review will obviously have their own share of problems with the code written months ago. When you know you have a large number of changes to make, and you are unsure of the progression, the freedom of working in a controlled branch will give you the peace of mind to just have at the code and swing it into gear.<br><br>There might be larger benefits as the number of files and the number of developers increase, but version control is not something you should wait for. It is an essential component of any project, and should be employed from day one as part of your regular infrastructure of development. Collaboration is not the only, or even the best thing these systems have to offer. We've talked about the branching, structuring, and good habits that use of version control systems and regiments bestows on a developer, and they apply to each of us individually before as a group.<br><br><h2>Avoid Using Version Control</h2><br>Developing is hard work and when you're just getting started with something or working on your own, you don't need any added distractions. Bringing in tools like a version control system is just asking for trouble when you have all the big issues to deal with in a new project. You're so constantly changing your code and your structure that putting something between you and your fresh code is asking for nothing but trouble. You can also import the code into a repository down the road, when things get complex, more people are getting involved, or just when it feels right. The VCS is just one more thing to worry about and you have enough of those to handle all on your own with a brand new baby project.<br><br>New developers, especially, should stay away from this kind of non-development detail. Version control might be important, but its not a detail the developer should have to care about, and even though you can't avoid that forever, when you're just getting your feet wet with the world of code, you need to expose yourself to a limited number of facets at a time. No budding programmer cares about version control when the code they are writing is so terrible they know they'll throw it away when they learn enough to have disdain for their own creations. Education and learning can't be jeoprodized by bothering students with trivial things.<br><br>The original creation of version control systems, usually attributed to the VCS utility of UNIX systems, was intended to lock portions of the source while you worked on them, and existed solely as a coordination tool for multiple developers. So, obviously there is no point in their use if you're the only developer. No matter how complicated your project gets, if you are the only person writing the code, there is no confusion to be had, and you can rest easy. Open the files you need, edit the code as you need, and you'll be fine.<br><br><h2>Discussion</h2><br>Spark some discussion. Make a comment. Play the Devil's Advocate and argue on the side you would not normally stand for. Fresh perspective is a good thing to have.<br>
