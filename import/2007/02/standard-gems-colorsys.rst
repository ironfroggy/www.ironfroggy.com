Lots of us do color work. Maybe you're writing a full-fledged Photoshop
killer, or you just want a utility to do some bulk conversions or color
scheme generations. Well, in any case, you might find the
often-forgotten colorsys module handy.
You can easily convert between different color component systems with
these included functions:
hls_to_rgb(h, l, s)
hsv_to_rgb(h, s, v)
rgb_to_hls(r, g, b)
rgb_to_hsv(r, g, b)
rgb_to_yiq(r, g, b)
yiq_to_rgb(y, i, q)
