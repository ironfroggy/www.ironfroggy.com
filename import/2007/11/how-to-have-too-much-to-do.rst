| I've got a lot of things I'd like to tackle and I just wanted to
  layout some of the things on my mind lately. Many of them are small,
  so maybe I'll even complete a few before 2008.

-  Launch a small, free service that uses a
   `del.icio.us <http://del.icio.us/>`__ account to take social
   bookmarks and forward them to Twitter or `Jaiku <http://jaiku.com>`__
   or `Onaswarm <http://onaswarm.com>`__ automatically.
-  Learn how to write a Firefox sidebar application and replace the
   crappy `TwitBin <http://www.twitbin.com/>`__. I want to only see the
   most recent status from each user and to remember my preferences
   better.
-  Develop a small desktop tool to grab my bugs from
   `FogBugz <http://www.fogbugz.com/>`__ and let me track time offline.
   This will come in handy when I travel around the holidays.
-  Get reacquainted with `Nevow and Athena <http://www.divmod.org/>`__
   for a few small games, like TicTacToe and Squares.
-  And, as I write this, I want something that will take highlighted
   text and replace it with a link to a Google search for the text.
   Easier than looking up the links to everything I just mentioned!

It really seems like an OK plate, now that I have it written out.
