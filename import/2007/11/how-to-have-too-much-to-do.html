I've got a lot of things I'd like to tackle and I just wanted to layout some of the things on my mind lately. Many of them are small, so maybe I'll even complete a few before 2008.<br /><ul><li>Launch a small, free service that uses a <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> account to take social bookmarks and forward them to Twitter or <a href="http://jaiku.com">Jaiku</a> or <a href="http://onaswarm.com">Onaswarm</a> automatically.</li><li>Learn how to write a Firefox sidebar application and replace the crappy <a href="http://www.twitbin.com/">TwitBin</a>. I want to only see the most recent status from each user and to remember my preferences better.</li><li>Develop a small desktop tool to grab my bugs from <a href="http://www.fogbugz.com/">FogBugz</a> and let me track time offline. This will come in handy when I travel around the holidays.</li><li>Get reacquainted with <a href="http://www.divmod.org/">Nevow and Athena</a> for a few small games, like TicTacToe and Squares.</li><li>And, as I write this, I want something that will take highlighted text and replace it with a link to a Google search for the text. Easier than looking up the links to everything I just mentioned!</li></ul>It really seems like an OK plate, now that I have it written out.
