Everyone is abuzz with the release of Flock 1.0 and I so wanted to get
on the bandwagon. I just couldn't make the jump. I tried to like it,
very hard. Twitbin trumps Flock's Twitter integration and the
del.icio.us bookmarks extension does a better job of helping me find my
bookmarks. I find it very annoying that I wanted Flock for integration
with online services, yet I couldn't remove the local bookmarks I care
nothing for from the bookmark sidebar.
Now, there were some things I really liked. I loved that logging into a
supported service configured it automatically. I want to see more of
that.
