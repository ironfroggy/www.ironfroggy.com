| Mark Hurst of Good Experience has had a `deceptive
  experience <http://www.goodexperience.com/blog/archives/009949.php>`__.
  I feel for his sense of accomplishment, but I'm here to let him and
  everyone know that an empty inbox is a terrible recipe for lost
  productivity.

   It was incredible. It was so stunning to me. I had written off the
   idea of ever having a totally empty inbox.

| The problem here is a subtle lie that none of realize we tell
  ourselves or others when we talk about the virtues of keeping a clean
  inbox. The word "inbox". I did all of this some time back, and I was
  really excited, just like Mark. It wasn't long before I realized I had
  only made things worse.
| Some people may know that I slowly slipped away from Python-Dev lists,
  and what you wouldn't know is one of the key causes to my lack of
  participation in mailing lists for some time now. The problem started
  when I added filters for all my mailing lists and started regiments to
  empty out my inbox to 0. I sat, looked at my wonderous empty inbox,
  and spent the next few months continually ignoring the non-empty
  labels hidden off in the label listing.
| Sure, my inbox can stay empty these days, but all we're doing is
  hiding the problem. Hiding a problem is not a solution.
