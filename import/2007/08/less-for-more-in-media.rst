| I think this is appropriate, because my favorite software is a
  transport for media. YouTube, music downloads, blogs, and web comics
  are all old media turned new. TV and movies are old and web videos are
  new. CDs are old and downloads are new. Books and magazines are old
  and blogging is new. Newspaper comics are old and web comics are new.
  Why did I single out comics? Because, Scott Adams, of
  `Dilbert <http://www.dilbert.com/>`__ fame (who has an excellent,
  `non-comic-centric blog <http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/>`__) took
  fledgely comic cartoonist, `Scott
  Meyer <http://www.basicinstinct.com/>`__, under his wing. This is old
  teaching new, and is interesting to watch.
| On the first post from Adams, I commented about how many cartoonists
  might not even want the traditional route of syndication, and will
  choose to stay with web formats. On part 2, I commented as follows:

   It is becoming one of the defining characteristics of the New Media
   that more people can make less money. To the eyes of the Old Media,
   this is obviously a Bad Thing. No one gets quite as much attention or
   makes quite as much money, but if you look at how many more people
   can make it at least to a good level, and you sum it all up, I'd be
   sure the overall industry makes more. To add to that, huge chunks of
   the money aren't going to syndication agencies and other central
   entities. More of the less money stays with the artists. The same is
   happening in moves from newspaper comics to web comics, music from CD
   to download, and sixty dollar video games being pushed aside for
   dozens of ten to twenty dollar smaller titles, each. The end is more
   variety, and a better chance of finding something that you like, more
   people make a living on what they love, and more of the profits
   staying with the people who are actually doing the creating. The old
   media will not go away for a long time, and we still need it, but the
   model simply changes. Cartoonists aren't supposed to make a million
   dollars a year any more, and that's OK if, instead, twenty or more
   cartoonists can make a very decent living with their craft, don't you
   agree?
