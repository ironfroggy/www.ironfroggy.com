Twitter pod is great, but its completely silent about authentication errors, apparently.  The root of the problem is that I have two twitter accounts: ironfroggy and pythoncoders, which I intended as an aggregator of python twitter accounts. At the very least, a place to find other pythoners on twitter. Now, I haven't been keeping up on pythoncoders, so I decided to log in and update the followings, only to realize I forgot the password. Here in lies the cause of my troubles.<br /><br />The twitter "reset password" form does not take a username. Oh, no, it takes an e-mail address, which  I have two accounts with the same of. I crossed my fingers, went through the process, and seemed to be brought back to my ironfroggy account, so I decided to figure it out later.<br /><br />Somehow, this process leaves the account with an unknown password, probably random or even null,  or for some reason the fact that they accept multiple accounts with the same e-mail is not taken into account in code paths that should care about it.<br /><br />I'm waiting for a solution, Twitter.<data:post.title></data:post.title>
