The more `peeks <http://ajaxian.com/archives/taking-a-peak-at-html-5>`__
I get at the HTML 5 spec, the more I dread it. We have barely shaken the
last strongholds of crap-HTML since gaining some sanity some years ago.
We put content in pages and we control style and layout in CSS,
supposedly. Now, we see upcoming tags like article and nav and section,
and all of it harks back to the days that were so dark in the web. I
don't understand it.
If anything, we should take the `suggestions of Douglas
Crockford <http://www.crockford.com/html/>`__ to heart. I want semantics
in my content, not layout or anything related to it. I want themes and
templates understood by the standard, not developed by a thousand
projects in parallel resource squandering.
Any complaints I make about the upcoming HTML spec is completely
trivialized by the fact that there is an upcoming HTML spec. Do you know
how long it has been since any major shift in web formats? We're talking
pre-Mozilla days here. I can't imagine the migration required with an
internet the size we have today. The web makes a great platform, in my
eyes, but upgrading the platform itself is working with the world's most
ineffectively administrable network. Deploying can take years, even
nearly to a decade.
We need to hold ourselves steady on the standards we can't even agree on
today and just stop jumping on them. Break the foundations, crumble them
down. Browsers are great at just working with what they're given. There
is no such thing as an error, only being less affirmative. If we can
take advantage of that, through arbitrary tags and attributes, we can
really build something out of less.
