So, I didn't see any opening for contributing in any useful way to the
discussion about Google's new `Chart
API <http://code.google.com/apis/chart/>`__, until I read `this
post <http://gulopine.gamemusic.org/2007/12/google-chart-api-revisited.html>`__.
How dare they call this service open. They should have been clear that
their greed has lead them to secretly hide abilities of the service from
the public, in an obvious attempt to corner the market on really cool
graphs in web sites.
My theory is that they hope everyone uses their "Open" Chart API, which
doesn't include the full service's abilities, so that their own charts,
using the entire breadth of charting power, are inherently better than
yours. Beware the wickedness of the corporate greed, my friend.
My sarcasm drips onto the floor. Now, I mean no disrespect to Marty, but
this kind of post really does get under my skin from time to time. Maybe
it just struck me at the wrong time. So what if Google has features they
didn't document? So what if they use a different URL to access the API?
Maybe the undocumented features are still in flux. Maybe they like to
see how many people outside Google are using the charts. There are
plenty of good reasons for everything he talks about them doing with
this and claims it to have some anti-open nature, but I just don't see
any of it.
For Google's Motivations This Means...
None of it really matters, in the end. Use the API or don't, but I don't
see a gain for them in the parts of the API they are letting us use, nor
do I care if they do gain. Gaining from something doesn't negate your
ability to do it for the reasons outside your gain. My job involves
writing software for a company that helps low-income families find
`affordable housing <http://www.socialserve.com/>`__. I get paid for my
job, so does that mean I can't lay claim to any good nature behind it?
