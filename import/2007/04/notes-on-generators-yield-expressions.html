I was messing around with the use of yield as an expression, the new feature in Python 2.5, and I got a little tripped in small cases of order with how you need to iterate over the generator and when you call send(), etc. I just thought I would post this example to make anyone passively reading aware of the ordering.<br /><br /><code><br />>>> def g():<br />...     print 1<br />...     print 2, (yield)<br />...     print 3<br />...<br />>>> gen = g()<br />>>> gen.next()<br />1<br />2<br />>>> gen.send(0)<br />0<br />3<br />Traceback (most recent call last):<br />  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module><br />StopIteration<br />>>><br /></code>
