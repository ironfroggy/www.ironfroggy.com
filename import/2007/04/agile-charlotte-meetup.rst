Attending my first meetup tomorrow for the Agile Charlotte group from
meetup.com. My old area, surrounded by cows and corn, had no chance of
getting any meetups, so I'm excited to be back at the city and able to
partake in some community. If anyone by chance is attending, or near
enough to make it, check out the information and drop a note.
