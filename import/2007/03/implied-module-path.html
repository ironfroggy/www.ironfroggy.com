We all know there is an implied path to import from for the main module, but it seems a few people get mixed about the details of how this works. In particular, it seems that this path is being confused for the <span style="font-style: italic;">current working directory</span>. Here is a little note to help remember the distinction.<br /><ul><li>Any module implicitly can import packages and modules in the same directory its file resides in, which is <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family:courier new;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">os.path.dirname(the_module.__file__)</span></span></span></li><li><span style="font-family:courier new;"><span style="font-family:georgia;">Often you run a script, when starting out, from its own directory, so that this implied path is the <span style="font-style: italic;">current working directory</span>. This fact is purely a coincidence.</span></span></li></ul>The result boils down simply to understanding that any import can be relative <span style="font-style: italic;">to the module it appears in</span>, and if you run a local (not system-wide available) script, that just happens to be your current directory, by coincidence.
