There is a `good
story <http://blog.nextblitz.com/blog/2007/04/ill_buy_that_bo.html>`__,
over at `NextBlitz <http://blog.nextblitz.com/>`__, about how the move
from subscription tiers to on-demand media consumption can invalidate
our entire traditional model of censorship and nearly eliminate much of
the reason the FCC exists.
It makes sense, and I've given it some thought before. We've always
needed to regulate what was broadcast over the airwaves, despite the
rights of free speech. Children and fragile people could be watching any
channel. The same equations just don't pan out anymore and they continue
to diminish in relevancy every day. For each family that acquires
on-demand media services, there is one less family that has to wonder
what might passively play on the screen when the kids are around.
