| I've been toying with the idea of increasing how much I might get back
  from this little place. At times it gets down right exciting to watch
  my hits rise day after day, until I get writers block again and drop
  back to double digits for a month or so. I can't help but listen to
  the entrepenourial spirit in me that suggests a little more devotion
  and disipline on my part would push the pocket pennies to a threshold
  the likes of my ramen-eating self would just drool over. Hell, I could
  even buy two flavors of ramen.
| So, I played with a few things. I naively made an attempt to jury-rig
  my Google Adsense snippets into my actual posts, to test what would
  come up in my reader. Squat, that's what. I looked around for
  feed-specific advertising services, and I found nothing but closed
  betas. I was seriously surprised at the lack of services in this area.
  Anyone who gets there first is going to have a serious advantage. Now,
  many someone is there first, so let me rephrase it as "someone who
  gets there first, in a noticeable way". It's enough to make a guy want
  a startup.
| The dead-ends I've crawled back from in this pursuit must have been
  littered with the sweat of others out there, looking for just this
  sort of thing. Some places are doing in-feed advertising in-house,
  such as Slashdot, but the rest of us are really left hanging. Every
  day I look at my hits through Adsense and I really have to wonder what
  I'm missing. If I'm getting so many people actually making their way
  to my page, how many aren't even doing that much and just read it
  through the aggregators and never browse to the site proper?

| One might suppose that the "real" hits are more important anyway.
  Those are the ones that really measure interest, not passive
  consumption. That isn't what this is about, anyway. I need some cold,
  hard cash.
| What is everyone's opinion on the different routes? I'd like to know
  both what anyone thinks personally and/or what experiences you've had
  with the options available.

#. What is to be done about the feeds (which are great) taking users
   away from our sites? Does this change the perspective of the entire
   web?
#. What about our feeds being interlaced with advertising, text and
   banner?
#. What reaction, if any, should the public have to paid advertising
   posts by bloggers and are they worth it?
