I've been building up a large collection of del.icio.us bookmarks tagged
'toread'. I have not been reading them. When information isn't on your
radar, it might as well not exist, so I decided to bring this stuff back
to my radar.
All I did was add my feed of 'toread' tagged bookmarks to my Google
Reader, and now everything I tag to read later, I'll see come up in my
feeds. If I decide to defer reading for even later, I can just not mark
the item read.
