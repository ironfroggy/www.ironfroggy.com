My adsense experiment didn't pan out. I shouldn't be surprised. I forgot
about the Adsense for Feeds Beta. If that exists, then obviously the
normal adsense doesn't work for feeds. I'll leave them in, anyway, just
to see what happens with the channels on the front page.
Took a look at web.py to see if it could be useful for our needs, but I
really can't tell entirely. I don't think so, however. The documentation
is just way too sparse.
