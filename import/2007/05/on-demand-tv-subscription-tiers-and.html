There is a <a href="http://blog.nextblitz.com/blog/2007/04/ill_buy_that_bo.html">good story</a>, over at <a href="http://blog.nextblitz.com/">NextBlitz</a>, about how the move from subscription tiers to on-demand media consumption can invalidate our entire traditional model of censorship and nearly eliminate much of the reason the FCC exists.<br /><br />It makes sense, and I've given it some thought before. We've always needed to regulate what was broadcast over the airwaves, despite the rights of free speech. Children and <span style="font-style: italic;">fragile</span> people could be watching any channel. The same equations just don't pan out anymore and they continue to diminish in relevancy every day. For each family that acquires on-demand media services, there is one less family that has to wonder what might passively play on the screen when the kids are around.<br /><br /><script type="text/javascript"><!-- google_ad_client = "pub-7984816525584511"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; google_ad_format = "468x60_as"; google_ad_type = "text_image"; //2006-10-05: Ranting Techno Rave RSS google_ad_channel ="2656351264"; google_color_border = "FFFFFF"; google_color_bg = "CAF99B"; google_color_link = "0000FF"; google_color_text = "000000"; google_color_url = "008000"; //--></script><br /><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"><br /></script>
