   I've been reading an eBook in my attempts at being a better blogger
   and reaching a wider audience, and although I recommend it to read by
   anyone with similar goals, its more how I got it than what I got that
   I wanted to bring up. Some might know that I recently looked into
   ways of capitolizing on my feeds. Nearly 70% of my traffic (maybe
   more) is via feed subscribers, who never see my advertising. That is
   quite a bit of lost revenue, not that it would add up to much if they
   all went straight to my front page. None the less, its a problem I
   want a solution to. Now, I really like feeds. I don't want to make
   you come to my website if you prefer feeds, because I know I don't
   even read websites these days unless they have a feed. Even if I find
   a particular article I like, I typically just subscribe to the feed
   and wait for the article to get to me through it. Still, others are
   not so open to the new medium, and often treat feeds marketing. Maybe
   they are. These people will give you just a few lines of preview,
   requiring you to following the link back to the original post. Maybe
   they'll strip media and links from the feeds, so you need to follow
   back to their site to read more on the topic. There are a host of
   ways of turning feeds into website traffic.
   That is why I found it wonderfully refreshing to see Chris Garrett
   actually going out of his way to entice users to subscribe to his
   feed in order to receive extra content that was unavailable through
   his website. Will this lead to a larger subscriber base? Probably.
   Will some portion of those readers follow back to his site from time
   to time? Probably. Will enticing users into a medium that is
   traditionally a drain on revenue and a problem for content creators
   who even love it actually benefit this man for his efforts? I think
   so.
   Now, what do I have to give?
