<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><br></br>Vias the <a href='http://vistascript.net/vistascript/docuwiki/doku.php'>Vista Smalltalk Wiki</a>, it looks like the DLR has gained a new language by a third party, implementing Lisp and Smalltalk. Correct me if I am wrong about that, but I am quite the Lisp-history Luddite and have no concept of the separation of Lisp, Scheme, and Smalltalk. Still, what I find most interesting about this is how the way the CLR and DLR works means we can put new languages into them and deploy with pretty much whatever we feel like so easily. Just think of all the purists out there that would love to put their half-a-century-old-baby into so many hands, although I suspect many of them aren't kind toward Redmond, so its another interesting pairing, for sure.<br></br><br></br>What's next? <a href='http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=72'>Subtext</a>?<br></br><br></br><br></br><p class='poweredbyperformancing'>Powered by <a href='http://scribefire.com/'>ScribeFire</a>.</p></div>
