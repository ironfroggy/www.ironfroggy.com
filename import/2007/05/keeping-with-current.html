I've been really trying to keep up with the feeds I read better and I found a change in my usage pattern that has helped a good bit. I stopped sorting or looking for specific feeds. No longer do I jump to the latests posts from <a href="http://xkcd.com">xkcd.com</a> or <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">thedailywtf.com</a>. I save time from sorting and get a broader range of posts at any one time. There is less topic burnout, also.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">(Topic Burnout is when you just can't read another word of some specific topic because you've absorbed so much of it too recently. Kind of like when you eat ramen for too many days in a row.)</span><br /><br /><script type="text/javascript"><!-- google_ad_client = "pub-7984816525584511"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; google_ad_format = "468x60_as"; google_ad_type = "text_image"; //2006-10-05: Ranting Techno Rave google_ad_channel ="8473164975"; google_color_border = "FFFFFF"; google_color_bg = "CAF99B"; google_color_link = "0000FF"; google_color_text = "000000"; google_color_url = "008000"; //--></script><br /><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"><br /></script>
