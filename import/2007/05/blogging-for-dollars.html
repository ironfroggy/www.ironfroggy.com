I've been toying with the idea of increasing how much I might get back from this little place. At times it gets down right exciting to watch my hits rise day after day, until I get writers block again and drop back to double digits for a month or so. I can't help but listen to the entrepenourial spirit in me that suggests a little more devotion and disipline on my part would push the pocket pennies to a threshold the likes of my ramen-eating self would just drool over. Hell, I could even buy <span style="font-weight: bold;">two</span> flavors of ramen.<br /><br />So, I played with a few things. I naively made an attempt to jury-rig my Google Adsense snippets into my actual posts, to test what would come up in my reader. Squat, that's what. I looked around for feed-specific advertising services, and I found nothing but closed betas. I was seriously surprised at the lack of services in this area. Anyone who gets there first is going to have a serious advantage. Now, many someone is there first, so let me rephrase it as "someone who gets there first, in a noticeable way". It's enough to make a guy want a startup.<br /><br />The dead-ends I've crawled back from in this pursuit must have been littered with the sweat of others out there, looking for just this sort of thing. Some places are doing in-feed advertising in-house, such as Slashdot, but the rest of us are really left hanging. Every day I look at my hits through Adsense and I really have to wonder what I'm missing. If I'm getting so many people actually making their way to my page, how many aren't even doing that much and just read it through the aggregators and never browse to the site proper?<br /><br /><script type="text/javascript"><!-- google_ad_client = "pub-7984816525584511"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; google_ad_format = "468x60_as"; google_ad_type = "text_image"; //2006-10-05: Ranting Techno Rave google_ad_channel ="8473164975"; google_color_border = "FFFFFF"; google_color_bg = "CAF99B"; google_color_link = "0000FF"; google_color_text = "000000"; google_color_url = "008000"; //--></script>One might suppose that the "real" hits are more important anyway. Those are the ones that really measure interest, not passive consumption. That isn't what this is about, anyway. I need some cold, hard cash.<br /><br />What is everyone's opinion on the different routes? I'd like to know both what anyone thinks personally and/or what experiences you've had with the options available.<br /><ol><li>What is to be done about the feeds (which are great) taking users away from our sites?
