   Vias the `Vista Smalltalk
   Wiki <http://vistascript.net/vistascript/docuwiki/doku.php>`__, it
   looks like the DLR has gained a new language by a third party,
   implementing Lisp and Smalltalk. Correct me if I am wrong about that,
   but I am quite the Lisp-history Luddite and have no concept of the
   separation of Lisp, Scheme, and Smalltalk. Still, what I find most
   interesting about this is how the way the CLR and DLR works means we
   can put new languages into them and deploy with pretty much whatever
   we feel like so easily. Just think of all the purists out there that
   would love to put their half-a-century-old-baby into so many hands,
   although I suspect many of them aren't kind toward Redmond, so its
   another interesting pairing, for sure.
