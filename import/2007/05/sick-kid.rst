So after staying up with my sick son until 4 AM, we took him into the
emergency room just before 6 AM. Needless to say, I've got little sleep
to go on. I figure its a good time to jump into that `polyphasic
sleep <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep>`__ stuff.
Obviously, I've gotten little done today in light of this.
