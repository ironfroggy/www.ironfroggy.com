Awesome concept over at <a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/">Lost Garden</a>. Stock art for a game was provided, far above the level of programmer art, and the challenge called to programmers to turn them into game prototypes, based on the design. A wonderful way to encourage a few people to get creative for a weekend. Game writing sprints always have some interesting stuff. The only problem with <a href="http://lostgarden.com/labels/SpaceCute.html">SpaceCute</a> is that it was a little too similar resulting in all the contestants. A little more flexibility would be welcome.<br /><br /><script type="text/javascript"><!-- google_ad_client = "pub-7984816525584511"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; google_ad_format = "468x60_as"; google_ad_type = "text_image"; //2006-10-05: Ranting Techno Rave google_ad_channel ="8473164975"; google_color_border = "FFFFFF"; google_color_bg = "CAF99B"; google_color_link = "0000FF"; google_color_text = "000000"; google_color_url = "008000"; //--></script><br /><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"><br /></script>
