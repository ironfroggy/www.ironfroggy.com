Awesome concept over at `Lost Garden <http://www.lostgarden.com/>`__.
Stock art for a game was provided, far above the level of programmer
art, and the challenge called to programmers to turn them into game
prototypes, based on the design. A wonderful way to encourage a few
people to get creative for a weekend. Game writing sprints always have
some interesting stuff. The only problem with
`SpaceCute <http://lostgarden.com/labels/SpaceCute.html>`__ is that it
was a little too similar resulting in all the contestants. A little more
flexibility would be welcome.
