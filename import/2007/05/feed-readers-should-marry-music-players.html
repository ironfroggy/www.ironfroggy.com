I always have one tab to the same page: <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">http://www.google.com/reader/view/</a><br /><br />So, the more it does, without stepping outside its boundries, the better. I have it there already. One fallacy I've seen already is the Google Reader handling of podcasts. The embedding flash app to play the MP3 for me is nice, until I want to read more while I listen.<br /><br />Google Reader Team: Add a feature that lets me queue these tracks to be played in a player outside the reading area, so it sticks around while I do other things. Even better, expose its playlist as an RSS feed so <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">my other online</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/">music players</a> can knock them into the playlists between their own tracks!<br /><br /><script type="text/javascript"><!-- google_ad_client = "pub-7984816525584511"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; google_ad_format = "468x60_as"; google_ad_type = "text_image"; //2006-10-05: Ranting Techno Rave google_ad_channel ="8473164975"; google_color_border = "FFFFFF"; google_color_bg = "CAF99B"; google_color_link = "0000FF"; google_color_text = "000000"; google_color_url = "008000"; //--></script><br /><script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"><br /></script>
