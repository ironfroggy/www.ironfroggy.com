| I wanted to post two related hex graphs that give us some good mind
  food to munch on while we work. The first is more general and tells us
  seven points of `User Experience <http://del.icio.us/ironfroggy/UX>`__
  `Design <http://del.icio.us/ironfroggy/design>`__. Take a step back
  and ask yourself:

-  Useful - Is the software even useful?
-  Usable - What it does is useful, but is it usable?
-  Findable - Can the user find what they need to use?
-  Accessible - Can all the users access it?
-  Desirable - Do the users want your
   `1 <http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=21332048#footnote_1>`__
   software?
-  Valuable - Is your software valuable enough for the user to retain?
-  Credible - Does the software look fake or are you trusted?

| Up second, adapted from the original for `social
  software <http://del.icio.us/ironfroggy/socialsoftware>`__ purposes.
  We're beginning to see more and more social software, and the seven
  elements given here fit nicely into all the services I use.

-  `Twitter <http://www.twitter.com/>`__ - Presence and sharing (of
   presence) and conversations (about presence).
-  `Blogger <http://www.blogger.com/>`__ - Conversations, reputation
   (comment count), sharing (ideas), groups and relationships (informal;
   by linking).
-  `MySpace <http://www.myspace.com/>`__ - I hate MySpace, but I use it
   anyway. Relationships and groups are obviously the focus.

| I take this in and consider how we break up these elements into
  different services, and the focus of each service on one or a few
  elements benefits us. Twitter does great at what it does, etc. But the
  separation also harms us. The little widgets we can put on different
  places to connect the services together only go so far. I have too
  many feeds, but obviously I can't send all my "tweets" through this
  feed, as is. So we're getting good at breaking things up, but I'm
  really waiting for how we'll bring it all back together.
