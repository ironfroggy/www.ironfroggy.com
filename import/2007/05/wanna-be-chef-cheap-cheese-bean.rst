| Not every geek hits it rich with just the right algorithm and moves to
  Miami when he (or she!) retires at 35. I am not among that group, or
  any group near it. Cutting budgets can mean crappy food while you
  work. Cheap and quick recipes can be useful. At the very least, some
  way to mix up the usual stuff with a minor twist can at least make the
  daily drudge a bit more acceptable, for the moment.
| This is my recipe for what I call Cheap Cheese Bean Casserole.
| Ingredients:

-  1 Cup Baked Beans (I prefer Bush's Maple Cured)
-  1 Slice Chedder Cheese
-  2 Beef Hotdogs (Cheese Dogs work well here)
-  1/2 Cup Slightly Crushed Saltine Crackers

| The instructions are dirt simple but the result is delicious, filling,
  and perfect on a cold day. Cut up the hotdogs and add to the beans.
  Cover with the chedder cheese and evenly cover the entire bowl with
  the crackers. Microwave on medium for 2:30. The cheese will melt into
  the beans, the crackers will be protected from the sauses and remain
  crisp. The result is great for five minutes and probably a collective
  $2 dollar price tag.
| Later this week I'll post about the results and recipe for my attempt
  at flame grilled, beef stuffed bell peppers. Also, I'll talk about why
  on earth I'm writing about cooking and posting recipes on a tech blog,
  so stay tuned for that!
