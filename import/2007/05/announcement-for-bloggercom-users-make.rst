We live in an open society. Make all of your profiles public, especially
if you're commenting on other's posts. Otherwise, its impossible to
respond. So, to someone named Patrick, I was in the middle of moving, so
I missed your comment about the Harrisburg Python Meetup, which really
stinks because I was really looking for one around that area. I'm in
North Carolina now, and there is an Agile group I go to occasionally but
I might need to make the moves to start a Python group near Charlotte,
NC.
