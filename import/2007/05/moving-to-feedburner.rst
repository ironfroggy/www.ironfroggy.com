   So I've been not using my Feedburner account for a while, largely
   because If I did people would still autodiscover the normal,
   Blogger-made feeds, so I would just segment my readers. Yes, I have
   *readers*. A little investigation lead to the forum post I link to
   below that shows how to solve this. I was motivated by two factors.
   First, that Google is buying FeedBurner. Two, that I want to move
   away from Blogger sometime, and this way I can keep the same Feed URL
   when I do.
