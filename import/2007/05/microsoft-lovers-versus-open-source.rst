The battle has gone on for a very long time. The Microsoft developers
hate the open source hippies. The code huggers hate the corporate dogs.
When does either side realize the dagger they're digging in is piercing
themselves, because we're all the same.
We code because we like it. Software is our craft and development tools,
languages, and software ecosystems are the spice racks for us chefs of
bytes. Some chefs enjoy working on the grill, and others can't get
enough from the stove. But if backyard grillers love a good lasagna and
bakers enjoy a barbecue, why can't our camps live and let live? Joe
likes GNU tools and Mary builds Silverlight apps in C#, so obviously
they need to glare at one another with malice, right? Wrong.
