I've been really trying to keep up with the feeds I read better and I
found a change in my usage pattern that has helped a good bit. I stopped
sorting or looking for specific feeds. No longer do I jump to the
latests posts from `xkcd.com <http://xkcd.com>`__ or
`thedailywtf.com <http://thedailywtf.com/>`__. I save time from sorting
and get a broader range of posts at any one time. There is less topic
burnout, also.
(Topic Burnout is when you just can't read another word of some specific
topic because you've absorbed so much of it too recently. Kind of like
when you eat ramen for too many days in a row.)
