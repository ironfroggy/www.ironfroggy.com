I always have one tab to the same page:
http://www.google.com/reader/view/
So, the more it does, without stepping outside its boundries, the
better. I have it there already. One fallacy I've seen already is the
Google Reader handling of podcasts. The embedding flash app to play the
MP3 for me is nice, until I want to read more while I listen.
Google Reader Team: Add a feature that lets me queue these tracks to be
played in a player outside the reading area, so it sticks around while I
do other things. Even better, expose its playlist as an RSS feed so `my
other online <http://www.pandora.com/>`__ `music
players <http://www.last.fm/>`__ can knock them into the playlists
between their own tracks!
