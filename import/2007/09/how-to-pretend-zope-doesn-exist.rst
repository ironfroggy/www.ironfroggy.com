   I'm doing my best to ignore that I just read `Well-kept secrets of
   Zope <http://faassen.n--tree.net/blog/view/weblog/2007/09/10/0>`__,
   which lists all sorts of things I'm interested in seeing developed
   and how Zope did it. Zope is our Simpson's to South Park's Python
   community. All of this ORM wild fire and debates about unicode
   support and web frameworks seem really petty when someone reminds us
   that Zope, which most of us never really look at, has been doing some
   of these things for over a ten years. That's practically a decade in
   software time!
   |image0|\ Will I settle back into a comfortable hole in the ground,
   cover my years, and chant "There's no such thing as Zope" or am I
   going to bite some pride and surround myself with Zope? The first
   talk for a CharPy meeting is going to be on Zope, and I'm going to
   ask a lot of questions about why it gets ignored and how someone
   really familiar with Python can get into Zope so late into the game.
   Now, I am not planning to drop everything else. I still think CouchDB
   has some interesting ideas that I'm pretty sure aren't part of ZODB.
   I'm also a huge Twisted fan, where it applies. We've had some
   segmenting problems in Python with Zope and non-Zope, Twisted and
   non-Twisted and, more recently, Django and non-Django. We seem to be
   gaining a habit of frameworks that gain a really large following and
   are really known to those who don't use them, who continually ignore
   the developments. If Zope and Twisted played together better, both in
   code and community, would Django ever have even surfaced to fill the
   gap? Would Rails have been irrelevant?
   We need to build some bridges, so who wants to shake hands?
