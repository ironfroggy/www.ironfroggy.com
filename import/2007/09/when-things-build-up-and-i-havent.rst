| When things build up and I haven't posted, what to write about is a
  difficult thing to decide. This is a dump of recent or queued topics
  just to get them out of the way for new things.
| What's Up With This Hip Cat:

-  Looks like we're getting Charlotte Python Group (CharPy) together,
   and hopefully having some coffee one morning this week. Let me know
   if you're interested!
-  I'm stretching my legs at a bigger desk in the home office.
-  I'm trying to consider how to approach an open Python position I
   found in this area versus a possibility with someone I had a great
   time working with in the past versus moving to Australia down the
   road.
-  Knitt and Oasis are great little indie games. I wish I could have
   taken part in PyWeek, but I am so busy! Pyglet looks interesting
   these days.
-  Took on a tight deadline project at the same time as work on Python
   Magazine ramped up, because I'm just that willing to bend over for
   money.

I know I don't write enough. I have to write my column for the October
issue of Python Magazine and maybe that will jog something in my brain.
