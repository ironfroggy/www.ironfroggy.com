<a href="profile/13682774192456462795" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)"></a>So, after posting about the exception raising list comprehensions, I got this:<br /><blockquote><a href="profile/13682774192456462795" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Kevin</a>   has left a new comment on your post "<a href="http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2007/09/how-to-add-memory-leaks-to-python.html" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">How to Add Memory Leaks to Python</a>": <br /><br />Doesn't '_' only exist in the interactive interpreter?</blockquote>  Kevin has a misunderstanding here in that there is a huge difference between the expressions <span style="font-style: italic;">_</span> and the <span style="font-style: italic;">locals()["_[1]"]</span>. You might spot why they are so different, or you might not. The second, the one from the list comprehension, is unable to be accessed by name directly. You can only get at it via the locals() and globals() functions, depending on your scope (locals() always works right after the LC in question, though). The name is intentially something that, if tried to resolve as an actual name in the scope, won't find the object in question. Python will look for _ and then do a subscript lookup on key 1 on it. This is completely different than actually looking up the name <span style="font-style: italic;">_[1]</span> in the dictionary where names are stored and grabbing up the value its bound to.<br /><br />So, Kevin, your question can be answered in that its irrelevant, because we aren't dealing with _ at all. Also, open your profile so I can respond to you directly, next time.
