We had the first meeting of CharPy, the Charlotte Python Group, this
morning at Nova cafe downtown. There were only three of us, but most
user groups only start with a handful of people, and I'm looking forward
to how it grows. We're going to keep this going on the 1st and 3rd
Fridays, and anyone else is welcome to join us.
