What do I want? Do I even need a phone? When the iPhone came out, my
first reaction was wishing it wasn't a phone. If I want a touch screen
in my pocket, shouldn't I safe money and open my options with a Nokia
Internet Tablet? The iPod Touch and the iPhone will be open, eventually.
They can be coerced into running new things, already. The Nokia has a
huge library of software, and can be made to run linux with lots of apps
I already use. The price is undeniably better, of course.
Everything says "Don't get the expensive Apple device," and yet, I want
to buy it. I even want the phone model, when I don't want a phone. What
great marketting.
If I could find any decently open e-paper device, I'd jump on it before
anything else.
