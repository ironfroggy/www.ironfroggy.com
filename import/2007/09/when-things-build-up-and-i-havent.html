When things build up and I haven't posted, what to write about is a difficult thing to decide. This is a dump of recent or queued topics just to get them out of the way for new things.<br /><br />What's Up With This Hip Cat:<br /><ul><li>Looks like we're getting Charlotte Python Group (CharPy) together, and hopefully having some coffee one morning this week. Let me know if you're interested!</li><li>I'm stretching my legs at a bigger desk in the home office.</li><li>I'm trying to consider how to approach an open Python position I found in this area versus a possibility with someone I had a great time working with in the past versus moving to Australia down the road.</li><li>Knitt and Oasis are great little indie games. I wish I could have taken part in PyWeek, but I am so busy! Pyglet looks interesting these days.</li><li>Took on a tight deadline project at the same time as work on Python Magazine ramped up, because I'm just that willing to bend over for money.</li></ul>I know I don't write enough. I have to write my column for the October issue of Python Magazine and maybe that will jog something in my brain.
