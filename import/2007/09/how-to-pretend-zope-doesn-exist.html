<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>I'm doing my best to ignore that I just read <a href='http://faassen.n--tree.net/blog/view/weblog/2007/09/10/0'>Well-kept secrets of Zope</a>, which lists all sorts of things I'm interested in seeing developed and how Zope did it. Zope is our Simpson's to South Park's Python community. All of this ORM wild fire and debates about unicode support and web frameworks seem really petty when someone reminds us that Zope, which most of us never really look at, has been doing some of these things for over a <span style='font-style: italic;'>ten years</span>. That's practically a decade in software time!<br/><br/><img style='margin: 5px; width: 274px; height: 330px; float: left;' src='http://www.athensartgroup.net/mm5/graphics/00000001/TMS010.jpg'/>Will I settle back into a comfortable hole in the ground, cover my years, and chant "There's no such thing as Zope" or am I going to bite some pride and surround myself with Zope? The first talk for a CharPy meeting is going to be on Zope, and I'm going to ask a lot of questions about why it gets ignored and how someone really familiar with Python can get into Zope so late into the game. Now, I am not planning to drop everything else. I still think CouchDB has some interesting ideas that I'm pretty sure aren't part of ZODB. I'm also a huge Twisted fan, where it applies. We've had some segmenting problems in Python with Zope and non-Zope, Twisted and non-Twisted and, more recently, Django and non-Django. We seem to be gaining a habit of frameworks that gain a really large following and are really known to those who don't use them, who continually ignore the developments. If Zope and Twisted played together better, both in code and community, would Django ever have even surfaced to fill the gap? Would Rails have been irrelevant?<br/><br/><span style='float: right;'>We need to build some bridges, so who wants to shake hands?</span><br/>  <br/><br/>Technorati Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://technorati.com/tag/python' class='performancingtags'>python</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://technorati.com/tag/zope' class='performancingtags'>zope</a></div>
