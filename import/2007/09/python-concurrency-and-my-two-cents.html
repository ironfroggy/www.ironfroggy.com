<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>This is not the first and it will not be the last that I write about the state of concurrency in Python, comment about some debate going on in the community, and outline what I think we need to solve any apparent problems and capitalize on what a lot of us think is the future of software development. Anyone following the Python blogs is bound to have caught wind of the Guido-Eckle debate about what Python 3.0 has become, compared to what it could have been. This was followed immediately by an <a href='http://blog.snaplogic.org/?p=94'>open letter</a> from <small><a title='Posts by Juergen' href='http://blog.snaplogic.org/?author=5'><big>Juergen</big></a><big> of SnapLogic about the GIL. I feel sure this has all happened again and that all parties involved are just playing some recorded macros.<br/><br/></big></small>The most compelling case we have right now against the arguments to remove the GIL are two. Firstly, it was already done! A branch of Python removed the GIL many years ago and actually found a two core/cpu system would run the same code slower, due to all the locking involved to protect mutable structures. So, while people continually say that the GIL needs to be removed, gets in their way, and generally is a wart on Python, we need to remind them that its been done and it was a bad idea. The GIL is not being kept in as a product of laziness.<br/><br/>Secondly, threading is not the definitive answer to concurrency needs! This is a really important one, because one of the areas that I always see the Python community strive at is finding the right way to replace the popular way. Threads are very popular in a lot of circles, but there is a huge consensus that they are simply a misrepresented de facto with little in the way of justifying the use they see. The Java world, in particular, seems to think that throwing threads at a problem can solve it. What we have to realize is how many problems are caused by threading and if they outweigh the benefits. A lot of us can't see those benefits through all that cost, so we've looked in other places for concurrency, and we've found it. In some ways, the GIL acts as a deterrent to force us into finding a better way. I, for one, am all for keeping it around just for that reason.<br/><br/>Where can I really go with this? Not far. I could ramble and rant about processes being better concurrency primitives than threads, but I don't feel this is the time or the place. But, please, can we stop asking for the GIL to be removed? No on is going to listen to that plea. The issue is going to come up again, and that is absolutely a promise. We're going to see this again and again, until we have something solid, standard, and powerful enough to distract the thread lovers from the GIL issues. I don't know what that solution is, but we need to figure it out soon. Guido is right, of course, and this is a library issue, not a language issue. However, we can't deny what value this library issue has for the language, and a little encouragement or name dropping on his part might do well to push a good answer to the forefront. Eventually, something needs to get to the point that we can bring it into the standard library and say "This is how you do concurrency in Python."<br/><br/>Who wants to answer the great question?
