The Chrome Development team is talking about `how much faster Chrome is
at loading your tabs when you
restore <http://chrome.blogspot.com/2015/09/chrome-improvements-for-faster-and-more.html>`__
from a previous session. This is a totally welcome improvement,
especially compared to Firefox's long superior handling of session
restore by on-demand loading tabs only when you switch to them. Chrome,
by contrast, has already penalized you for every extra tab you had to
restore by loading them all at once and immediately.
But, something is missing from these announcements about improving the
speed. On the *forthy-fifth* release of the Chrome browser, I would have
expected and been happier with finally improving the plain experience of
restoring a previous session in the first place.
Chrome doesn't even *prompt* you to restore your tabs or even tell you
there is a session that could be restored, if you don't explicitly go
looking for it.
Hidden behind the main menu button that many users *don't even recognize
and know is a menu*, and then within the "History and Recent Tabs" you
actually get the option to restore a previous session. Many users I've
asked (anecdote, I know) don't even know this feature exists, and have
just been assuming Chrome forgets all their tabs on close or crash.
When you do know about and use the feature, it leaves a dead empty
window because it opens the previous session in a second window, and if
you have pinned tabs it creates duplicates of them *every time*. This
has felt less like weird behavior and more like buggy software for
*years* now.
So, they make opening that old session faster? That's great, but maybe
making it actually *work* first would be a better priority.
