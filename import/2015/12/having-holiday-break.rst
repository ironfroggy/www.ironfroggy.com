   Enjoying two weeks off for the holidays was a fabulous decision.

   It isn't far into it, technically only one day if you don't count the
   weekend that would have been there even if I didn't take a holiday,
   but I can already feel my stress fading away as I look forward to
   Christmas, to time with my wife and son, to visiting my in-laws and
   to just enjoying my home, with movies and video games and relaxing
   afternoons on the couch with the dog at my feet.

   I've taken two weeks off, partly because I realized how much time I
   had saved up. I'm really happy I can do so, but it also made me
   realize I need to take time off more often. I took three days off in
   November to coincide with a school break of my son's and it was just
   so great.

   I am going to make an effort to relax better and more pre-emptively.
