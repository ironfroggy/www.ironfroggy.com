This situation comes up, from time to time, when we need to get something to happen after a many-to-many field is changed. The novice will connect a post_save signal and scratch his head when it doesn't fire on the addition or removal of items in the ManyToManyField. We all learn that it takes a slightly more complicated signal, the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/signals/#m2m-changed">m2m_changed signal, and its many actions</a>, which tell us exactly what has changed in the particular field sending it (the signal comes from the field's through table, to be exact).<data:post.title></data:post.title><br /><div><br /></div><div>Well, a slightly more complicated case arose in a design today and I was scratching my head and feeling like a novice all over again. You see, I needed to know when new things had been adding to such a field, but I had more than one. In fact, I had four of them. I needed a specific function called on the instance when all of these fields were finished being cleared or added to or subtracted from. This was in a form in the Django admin.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thankfully I had an assumption I could make this easier with: the fields in question would only be set from the admin interface. With this knowledge in hand, I hopped into the app's admin.py and I added these methods:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;def response_change(self, request, obj):<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;response = super(MyAdmin, self).response_change(request, obj)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;obj.do_thing()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return response<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;def response_add(self, request, obj, *args, **kwargs):<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;response = super(MyAdmin, self).response_add(request, obj, *args, **kwargs)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;obj.do_thing()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return response<br /><br />These get called when the admin interface is used to edit and create a new object, respectively. It happens <i>after</i>&nbsp;both the model instance itself and all of the many-to-many fields have been saved, which is exactly what we need. It works, but I wish I could find a better solution.<br /></div>
