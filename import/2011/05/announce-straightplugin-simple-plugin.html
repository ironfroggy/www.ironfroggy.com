Tonight I uploaded straight.plugin 1.1 to the Python Package Index. This release includes a new loader, straight.plugin.loaders.ClassLoader and adds an subclasses parameter to the simple load() API to invoke class loading, opposed to the default module loading. The classes are filtered by type and are looked up in the same modules that would be loaded by the ModuleLoader available in straight.plugin 1.0. This release has been testing on Python 2.7 and 3.2.<div><br /></div><div>You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/ironfroggy/straight.plugin">source at github</a> or the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/straight.plugin/1.1">packages at PyPI</a>.</div>
