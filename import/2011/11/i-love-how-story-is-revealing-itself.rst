      I love how the story is revealing itself. I am not planning much,
      but many possibilities are popping into my head as I start to make
      connections in the story. Partly i wonder if i should avoid them,
      maybe they are too obvious since i thought of them just from what
      i’ve written? I don’t know. I’ll probably run with it, I need the
      material, after all.
