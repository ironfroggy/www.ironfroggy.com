My Month-Project for June 2011 was the 2.0 release of the JournalApp
tool I built during PyCon. I'm going to give a quick overview here, but
I really hope anyone with the least bit of interest in what I do will go
and look for themselves. I also think you should give it a try, but I
don't think its for everyone. I think there are ways to sort your
thoughts that work for us and we have different methods that will work
best for us. This works best for me. If it works for you, great. If not,
I hope you find something for you.

   The easiest way for me to summarize it is to just copy-paste the help
   page right here.

      Write. 

   ..

      Write #awesome things and tag use hashtags to find them later. 

      Find things by hashtag by typing only the tags you want to
      search. 

   ..

      ``#likethis`` 

      Have something to do? 

   ..

      TODO: write todo's in your entries. 

      DONE: and click them to check them off. 

   ..

      ALSO: notice you can use "todo" or \ *any* word you want. 

      Like searching for tags, you can also search for todo items, or
      whatever word you used. You can even mix them with hashtags!
      Here's how I find a list of books i want to read. 

   ..

      ``#reading book:`` 

       Finally, while you are searching, \ *anything*\  you write gets
      the current hashtags automagically 

   ..

       You can use this to create separate notebooks, topics, or any
      other way you want to organize.
