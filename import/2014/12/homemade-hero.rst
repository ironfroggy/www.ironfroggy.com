Handmade hero looks like an amazing project.
If you're a long time game developer, new to it, or develop in some
other discipline I think you have to respect the goals Casey has laid
out for himself here. Developing an old style game from scratch *live*
every weeknight is both a wonderful personal project and a beautiful
piece of art.
