   I upgraded my phone from the original HTC One to the HTC One M8,
   which was a really clear choice because I just loved the HTC One, but
   unfortunately this is what mine looked like eventually:

   It still works, if you\ `want it for

   The M8 is exactly what I was looking for. It feels familiar, like
   holding a softer edged version of my One that fixes a few of a rare
   complaints I had, mostly around the purple-tinted sapphire lens
   camera. This is the first time I have replaced an Android phone
   without being frustrated by the performance of the previous. My HTC
   G1 (the first Android phone) and my LG G2 X (the supposed successor
   flagship) were both great phones when I got them and I still have
   both, in various levels of “working condition”, but they both showed
   signs of age as newer and newer applications ran sluggishly or
   refused to run at all on their dated hardware.

   Android hardware skyrocketed for the first few years, but I think
   we’ve seen it taper off now, and that’s a good thing.

So these days I can buy a phone and just select it based on factors that
don’t have much to do with the hardware, because all of it is pretty
great. Its hard to buy a bad Android phone these days if you aren’t some
kind of hardcode mobile gamer.
