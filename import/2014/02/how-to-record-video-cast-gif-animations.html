I'm playing with some game dev fun on the side, and as part of motivating myself I hope to have something to post to /r/GameDev's Screenshot Saturday event every weekend. This quickly got me wanting to show off something other than a still image, so I went looking for how people produce the animated screenshot GIFs I see developers posting of their games all over. Here's what I found:<br /><br />Step 1: CamStudio<br /><br />This open source screencast recorder is very simple, very light, free, and does a good job of recording a basic AVI screencast of a portion of your screen. You can set it to record just the part of your screen where your game is running, so you don't need to worry with post-processing crop. I tried a few other tools before this, and all of them had more up-front configuration and none of them really worked well. Either they only recorded black, or they had awful framerates, or they made my whole system crawl.<br /><br />Just get <a href="http://camstudio.org/">CamStudio</a>.<br /><br />Step 2: VirtualDub<br /><br />Maybe there is another more straight forward tool, but the first I tried (OpenAviToGif) just crashed after the first frame. VirtualDub seems to be for some other features that, frankly, I didn't even pay attention to. But, it has a simple export feature that can convert your CamStudio recorded AVI into a GIF very easily.<br /><br />Download <a href="http://virtualdub.sourceforge.net/">VirtualDub</a> from their Sourceforge page.<br /><br />Step 3: Post to /r/GameDev<br /><br />Just do it, every Saturday. <a href="http://reddit.com/r/gamedev/">Tons of fun</a>!<br /><br /><i>and as an extra, here's my first:</i><br /><i><br /></i><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4_ZvRH2_LTw/Uv9_Zvnp0dI/AAAAAAAAFUk/UXpFattRHAo/s1600/petri-demo.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4_ZvRH2_LTw/Uv9_Zvnp0dI/AAAAAAAAFUk/UXpFattRHAo/s1600/petri-demo.gif" height="239" width="320" /></a></div><i><br /></i>
