I'm playing with some game dev fun on the side, and as part of
motivating myself I hope to have something to post to /r/GameDev's
Screenshot Saturday event every weekend. This quickly got me wanting to
show off something other than a still image, so I went looking for how
people produce the animated screenshot GIFs I see developers posting of
their games all over. Here's what I found:
Step 1: CamStudio
This open source screencast recorder is very simple, very light, free,
and does a good job of recording a basic AVI screencast of a portion of
your screen. You can set it to record just the part of your screen where
your game is running, so you don't need to worry with post-processing
crop. I tried a few other tools before this, and all of them had more
up-front configuration and none of them really worked well. Either they
only recorded black, or they had awful framerates, or they made my whole
system crawl.
Just get `CamStudio <http://camstudio.org/>`__.
Step 2: VirtualDub
Maybe there is another more straight forward tool, but the first I tried
(OpenAviToGif) just crashed after the first frame. VirtualDub seems to
be for some other features that, frankly, I didn't even pay attention
to. But, it has a simple export feature that can convert your CamStudio
recorded AVI into a GIF very easily.
Download `VirtualDub <http://virtualdub.sourceforge.net/>`__ from their
Sourceforge page.
Step 3: Post to /r/GameDev
Just do it, every Saturday. `Tons of
fun <http://reddit.com/r/gamedev/>`__!
