I'm looking to gauge interest in the community for building a feature
postmortem blog. I tweeted the idea yesterday and immediately had some
people who seemed to like the idea as much as I do.
The goal would be writing in the context of a project about a specific
feature you built, what you needed to refactor to make room for it, and
what how your previous decisions had helped or made difficult the new
work you were doing. How was the work able to be broken down? Did you
account for future changes you know you'll make? What work did you
intentionally leave for tomorrow or the next developer?
At the heart of this idea is the thought process in my head when I sit
down and work on something specific, and wanting to share that process
with others and to get the same back to them. I would love to curate a
reader submitted collection of these stories.
Is there an interest? Please tell me if you'd like to read this and
*especially*Â if you'd like to contribute!
