   Dead to Me! is a new thing I’m doing. This is not a new blog, but it
   is a specific series of posts within this blog. Dead to Me! is about
   those projects which I am only looking back on, but will not work on
   again. These aren’t all failed experiments, but some of them are. In
   each post I’ll talk about a project I’ve abandoned, sunsetted, or
   moved on from. Some of them will be recent and others will be things
   I worked on years ago. Some of them might be related to work, but
   most will be personal.

   I’m also doing something different with this. I don’t know how well
   this part will work out, but I’ve already gotten some interest in it
   so we’ll see:

   I am soliciting for guest posts to Dead to Me! and welcome anyone who
   would like to ask to be a part of this. If you have a project you’re
   no longer working on and would like to write a postmortem for,
   please\ `drop me a line or a
   draft <mailto:ironfroggy+deadtome@gmail.com>`__\ .

   If you’d like your post to appear here, go ahead and post it on your
   own blog or anywhere else, as well. Perhaps we can cross-link them.

I think this will be fun. Will you join me?
You can read the first post of the Dead to Me! series right now,

development. <http://techblog.ironfroggy.com/2014/10/dead-to-me-trapdoor-prototyping-web.html>`__
