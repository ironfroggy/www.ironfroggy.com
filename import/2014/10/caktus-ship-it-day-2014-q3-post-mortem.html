<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Today was one of our very fun <a href="http://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2012/10/01/planning-our-first-shipit-day-caktus/">Ship It! Day</a>&nbsp;events at Caktus Group and the first in our new office. It snuck up on a lot of us, what with the busy move we're still settling down from, but it also is a great chance to unwind and to really enjoy our new shared workspace.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I'm going to start ending these events with a personal post-mortem on what I worked on. I decided to learn about WebRTC by building a tool I'd love to have with friends: a shared music player. The problem is simple: some of us think the room is to quiet and some of us like quiet. What we need is a way to play music together with headphones.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The goal was a simple app that can play MP3s. Everyone with the app open should be able to play songs and everyone connected would listen at the same time. We all hear the same thing. If someone leaves, they'll take their music with them.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">So, I set about this yesterday afternoon (when our Ship It festivities officially begin) and I had a vague idea where I wanted to start. I had seen an interesting proof-of-concept called instant.io which provided file sharing in the browser. What made it novel from other demos was its use of BitTorrent as the sharing mechanism, so it could be used to effectively distribute a large file to a large number of recipients efficiently!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">My starting theory was</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-size: large;">BitTorrent combined with Winamp, in your Browser</span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">So I set on this task by cloning the <a href="http://instant.io/">instant.io</a> repository and running it locally, which was a little more trouble than I expected. The actual setup of the project was pretty odd, and depended on things specific to the owners machine. What I did learn from instant.io was to find my way to the WebTorrent project, on top of which instant.io was built.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I cleaned up the repository I had cloned to run a bit easier on my machine and started pulling examples from the WebTorrent website. I quickly got the file sharing working locally, dropping files onto one browser and seeing download links appear in the second.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">So far, so good!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The next step was&nbsp;rudimentary&nbsp;music playing. I dropped a simple HTML5 audio tag into the page</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-size: large;">&lt;audio controls /&gt;</span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">And took a look at where the instant.io code was rendering its download links after completing the transfer of a file from one peer to the next. It was easy enough to find where it looped through the files of a completed torrent and wrote the links into the page.</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><pre>torrent.files.forEach(function (file) {<br />    file.createReadStream().pipe(concat(function (buf) {<br />      var a = document.createElement('a')<br />      a.download = file.name<br />      a.href = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([ buf ]))<br />      a.textContent = 'download ' + file.name<br />      log.innerHTML += a.outerHTML + '<br />    }))<br />  })</pre></blockquote><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">A torrent can contain multiple files, and that was a fact that I had neglected, but for the current testing I just assumed that I'm only dropping one file at a time and I just take the first file in the torrent. It was very easy to assign the Data URI being generated here to the audio tag and trigger playback.</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><pre>  var file = torrent.files[0]<br />  file.createReadStream().pipe(concat(function (buf) {<br />    var a = document.querySelector('audio')<br />    a.src = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([ buf ]))<br />    a.play()<br />  }))<br /></pre></blockquote><span style="font-family: monospace;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Success! I had, in less than an hour, built a simple tool that lets a bunch of people drop any MP3 into their browser window and all be listening to the same song in just a few seconds. It worked great, but I had a lot of work ahead of me.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><h3><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><i>Part 1: Proof of Concept in Under an Hour</i></span></h3><h3><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><i>Part 2: <a href="http://techblog.ironfroggy.com/2014/10/caktus-ship-it-day-2014-q3-post-mortem_13.html">Playlists and Reseeding Songs</a></i></span></h3><h3><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><i>Part 3: Two Steps Back and Three Steps Forward</i></span></h3>
