   I'm not a fish flopping around on the boat, struggling to pull
   through my gills water that isn't there. That's the image Jon Morrow
   would have you imagine for people like myself: writers who don't get
   to write. In
   his\ `verypoignantpiece <http://boostblogtraffic.com/quit-your-job/>`__\ ,
   Morrow talks about the nightmares and pain stuck in a life he didn’t
   really enjoy, until he let go and gave himself to wordcraft.

   I think anyone with a passion they’ve stifled can sympathize, but I
   don’t agree with his conclusions of advice to writers-who-could.

   Contrasted to Morrow’s do-or-die struggles and deep dive to arguable
   save his life, I’m reminded of the always articulate\ `Matt Gemmell’s
   announcement <http://mattgemmell.com/making-changes/>`__\ at the
   start of 2014 that he would be shifting to writing full-time and no
   longer continuing his successful programming career or his seven year
   self-employed stint in the Apple universe.

   Look at the different ways these two writers describe their life away
   from writing.

   My subconscious was trying to warn me that I was suffocating, just
   like a fish.

   and

**
**

.. container::

   all fell by the wayside when I became really interested in
   programming

**
**

.. container::

   There is an frantic nature to Morrow’s history before going at
   writing full-time that contrasts immensely to the gradual
   realizations Gemmell reveals. But beyond this, the difference I
   notice most is a projection that screams from Morrow and is
   completely absent from Gemmell.

**
**

.. container::

   Jon Morrow doesn’t write about his own realizations of purpose except
   as a backdrop addressing “Writers struggling to find their courage”.
   I find this characterization presumptuous and quite possibly
   reaching. Maybe he needs to share this feeling of imprisonment with
   others, so that a shared appreciation of escape can be had?

**

.. container::

   Instead, I find myself connecting far more with Gemmell’s position
   and path. That isn’t to say that I’m not going to code anymore, or
   that I’m turning my life into something new and becoming a writer
   first and foremost. Just the opposite, in fact. It is not Gemmell’s
   decision to leave programming and write full-time that I relate to,
   but the casual nature by which he seemed to come to it that I relate
   to.

**
**

.. container::

   Instead of the frantic fear I read from Morrow, in Gemmell I see
   someone who is not diving in head first, but is taking stock of his
   surroundings and just being honest about where he already is. I see
   someone who is able to bridge two different kinds of lives with a
   grace that is refreshing among advice that such change requires risks
   that many of us really can’t afford to take.

**
**

.. container::

   And that’s okay.

**
**

.. container::

   I am a firm believer that there is no inherent value in those kind of
   big risks being taken. They hold a position of esteem that, to me,
   just hides the problems that push people to this edge in the first
   place. (But this is for another discussion)

**

.. container::

   So I’m not here announcing some big life change, just a small one I’m
   observing. I’m writing more again, lately. I like that. I’ve been
   writing more every day, and I feel happier for it. I’m not letting it
   take over my life, and I’m happy for that, too. I don’t think I need
   to give up everythingelseI love to pursue writing more seriously. I’m
   a firm believer that dedicating your life to one pursuit, while often
   seen as noble and honorable, is a waste of potential.

   The breadth and depth of a human life is perfectly sufficient for
   being passionate of many things.

.. container::

   The the flying fish that soars through both ocean and sky, there are
   many people who have deeply engaged lives filled with creativities
   beside their office jobs and theyliketheir office job, too. There are
   people who write and publish and wonder when they’ll have time to
   paint, so they do that on the side. There are people who spend all
   day getting tired in labor intensive jobs andreally genuinely enjoy
   themand come home and hack on open source.

I reject the falsehood that passion requires isolation.
