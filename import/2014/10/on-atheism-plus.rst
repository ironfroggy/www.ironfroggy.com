*\ "Atheism Plus" has been making rounds for a while now.

   The basic premise seems to be Atheism, plus a lot of social justice
   movement elements. And, completely, I support that. And I'm glad for
   the wide support from others I see from that. We should support women
   in the Atheist community, and gays and bisexuals and the
   transgendered among us. And those outside of us, who are still
   marginalized even by religions they're a part of. We should support
   people of color, and the poor, and immigrants and single mothers
   more. Intersectionality is the word.

   post <http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2012/08/21/why-atheism-plus-is-good-for-atheism/>`__\ .

   But, I don't think we need a label for this. That doesn't mean there
   isn't a reason for it, and maybe I should phrase it "I don't think we
   should need it.", so let me explain.
