<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">If you download Firefox on a linux machine today what you get from their servers is a pretty unfriendly tarball. What are you supposed to do with this? Maybe you know how to extract a tarball. Maybe you even know what of the many files inside it you're actually supposed to run <i>and</i>&nbsp;how to run it? Maybe.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">But does everyone else? Do non-developer users have any clue what they're doing with this thing? They experience is awful.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I want to see that change and followed&nbsp;a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=641210">ticket</a> that tracks just that. What do you think?</span>
