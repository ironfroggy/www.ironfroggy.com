If you download Firefox on a linux machine today what you get from their
servers is a pretty unfriendly tarball. What are you supposed to do with
this? Maybe you know how to extract a tarball. Maybe you even know what
of the many files inside it you're actually supposed to run and how to
run it? Maybe.
But does everyone else? Do non-developer users have any clue what
they're doing with this thing? They experience is awful.
I want to see that change and
followed a\ `ticket <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=641210>`__\ that
tracks just that. What do you think?
