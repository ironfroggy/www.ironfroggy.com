   I want to write more often. I’ve been writing more lately and I hope
   to continue that, and I think expressing why this is important to me
   is valuable so here is that post.

   I want to explore my thoughts more concretely and have a record of
   how I came to my stands on the positions I believe in, and I want to
   keep track of the ideas for stories I have. Rather than have some
   bothering me constantly, I want to feel safe that I can forget
   things.

   Writing ideas can also get themoutof your mind. The act of writing
   about it can often free your mind from the burden of so many
   thoughts. You can be more confident in an idea, or let it go out of
   your mind now that you’ve written it somewhere safe and permanent.

   I like the idea of turning my thoughts into essays. A thought is
   ill-defined. A thought is hard to grasp, even inside your own head.
   Thoughts are connections between so many points in your mind, but a
   well written essay is a single coherent position. It is a statement
   at a time and place that expresses a piece of yourself succinctly and
   I really appreciate that about writing.

   Writing makes creative endeavours more accessible and helps keep my
   brain active and healthy. This practice of expressing thoughts in
   writing also gives you the practice in patterns of thinking that are
   better structured. The more of your thoughts find their way onto
   paper (literally or virtually) the easier they’ll come because your
   mind will learn to organize them better.

   I’ve begun the practice of\ \ `Morning
   Pages <http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/>`__\ \ again
   after years of allowing the habit to lapse.

   Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness
   writing done first thing in the morning. \*There is no wrong way to
   do Morning Pages*– they are not high art. They are not even
   “writing.” They are about anything and everything that crosses your
   mind– and they are for your eyes only. Morning Pages provoke,
   clarify, comfort, cajole, prioritize and synchronize the day at hand.
   Do not over-think Morning Pages: just put three pages of anything on
   the page…and then do three more pages tomorrow.

   I use a version of morning pages called 750words.com which is a
   fantastic tool that helps you write every day by tracking your words
   (750 words is roughly three pages) and each month provides a
   challenge to fill every day with these words.

   It has helped a lot. I start every day writing between 750 and 1000
   words with as little pausing as I can. In this time I get lots of
   stressful and worried thoughts out of my mind, or get a chance to
   think harder about them and settle on decisions that have been
   bothering me. I begin each day by clearing from my head many of the
   distractions that would keep me from the things I enjoy and the
   things I need to focus on.

   My work and my happiness have both improved as a result, I believe. I
   find myself focusing on work easier and I find myself able to enjoy
   my relaxing and hobby times, as well.

   What is most interesting, perhaps, is how muchmoreI have written in
   this same time. On top of writing every morning, I find myself
   feeling drawn every day to sit down and write even more and I do.
   I’ve written, roughly, 20,000 words in the last two weeks. And other
   creative interests have become easier, as well. I’ve been drawing and
   (digitally) painting more for the first time inyears, and I cannot
   express how happy that makes me.

   I hope that I do not let up on these changes any time soon.
