I grew up with my long lost brother, but that fact does not make the
label any less true. I don't know much about him. There are people I
worked with at short retail jobs in my teens who I got to know better
than I ever knew my little brother. There was not a drifting apart and
there was not any kind of animosity that kept us apart from the start. I
care for my brother and love my brother like anyone would.
But I do not know my brother.
If you think it is disingenuous of me to call him a "long lost brother"
when we grew up together and I remember him smiling from his crib,
please understand. If a man reached my age of thirty and only then
learned they had a brother they had never met, never spoken with, never
heard of before they would know that brother better than I know mine.
They would know at least that he, too, had a long lost brother.
It is not accurate to say that I miss my brother, because you cannot
really miss those who you don't know. I missed by brother, the way you
miss a fly ball.
