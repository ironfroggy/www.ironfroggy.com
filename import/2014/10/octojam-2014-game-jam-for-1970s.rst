   From the\ `OctoJam <http://octojam.com/>`__\ page:

   Chip8 is a language that let programmers write portable games for
   8-bit home computers in the 1970s. Today, Chip8 lives on in the form
   of emulators. 

   `Octo <http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/>`__\  is a tool that makes
   it easy to write and share Chip8 programs. Roll up your sleeves and
   join us for a retro game-jam celebrating Chip8!

And the gamejam rans through October. I love me a long-running gamejam,
because I don't have time to devote an entire weekend to these things.
What will you build using this (emulated) old hardware?
