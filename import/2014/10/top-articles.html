<h2 style="background-color: white; font-stretch: normal; margin: 0px 0px 1em; position: relative;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Along the side of my blog, for many years. I've had a section called "Top Articles". I don't remember when I put it there, but I know that it included all of the most popular posts I had written at the time and I wanted to make them more prominent. They were obviously popular topics people wanted to find. These were the things I was writing about that people found most interesting or useful.</span></span></h2><div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I haven't thought a lot about this list for a few years, until I just noticed it today. <i>Top Articles</i>&nbsp;is a time capsule. This was a snapshot of my interests and knowledge from a previous version of myself. It doesn't reflect me as well today. I'm equally interested in the things that no longer worth keeping on that list as I am of the things that are still very important to me.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'll make a point to clean things up around here.

Signs of the holistic approach to building software that I try to take these days already forming so long ago.</span></div><div><span style="color: #666666; font-family: Open Sans;"><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 14.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="widget-content" style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 12px;"><ul style="line-height: 1.2; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 1.25em;"><li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.25em 0px;"><a href="http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2007/11/how-to-work-sigmoid.html" style="color: #888888; text-decoration: none;">How To Work a Sigmoid</a></li><li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.25em 0px;"><a href="http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2007/06/chaos-theory-of-user-ingenuity.html" style="color: #888888; text-decoration: none;">The Chaos Theory of User Ingenuity</a></li><li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.25em 0px;"><a href="http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2007/06/giving-google-my-soul.html" style="color: #888888; text-decoration: none;">Giving Google My Soul</a></li><li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.25em 0px;"><a href="http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2007/02/extreme-code-version-control-for-one_12.html" style="color: #888888; text-decoration: none;">Version Control From One File</a></li><li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.25em 0px;"><a href="http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2006/04/how-my-websites-can-get-along.html" style="color: #888888; text-decoration: none;">How My Websites Can Get Along</a></li></ul><div><span style="line-height: 14.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: small;">This blog was started in January of 2007. That's over seven and a half years ago, nearly as old as my son, who is a third grader. I'm sure the focus and breadth of my writing has changed since then, as have my opinions and focus. I'm sure over the next seven years they'll continue to do so, and I hope over that time I'll continue to write about it all.</span></div></div>
