   Growth is not something we’re really instilled with when we’re
   growing up, ironically enough.

   Flashbacks in movies to the protagonist’s youth tend to show a
   mini-version of the adult, full of nods to their grown-up selves.
   Here you can see the people they will grow into already taking shape.
   Often, the younger versions of characters in a flashback will be
   almost identical to the older in personality. This is especially true
   in group flashbacks.

   Growth, we’re told over and over, is a straight line up. The kind of
   growth we’re not exposed to is growth that shoots off in directions
   you never anticipated. We aren’t told to expect and never to embrace
   changes in yourself that alter you so fundamentally you aren’t even
   recognizable any longer to your younger self.

   When growth surprises us, we’re taken off guard. We’re afraid.

   There is so little left of the boy I was not that long ago. Who I’ve
   become is so much more than older. The changes in my understanding of
   the world, in how I hold my own image in my mind, in my religion and
   values are so different from the trajectory as a child, which were so
   different than myself as a teenager, so different from my younger
   adult self, so different from myself today.

   There is going to be a man wearing some of my clothes, married to my
   wife, father to my son in a few years time. He’s going to hold a
   driver’s license with his face and my name. This man will share my
   birthday and social security number, but I cannot be sure that this
   man is going to bemeand this is simultaneously frightening and
   exciting.

   We’re all like the phoenix, the mythical bird that bursts in a
   blazing fire at the end of each life, only to be reborn from the
   ashes. But we can do thisso much more often.

   I’m reminded of a common phrase: kill your heroes. Not literally, of
   course. This is meant to understand that your heroes are nothing more
   than normal people. Hold them on your level. If we apply this to
   ourselves, I think we can learn to let go of the preconceived notions
   we build about who we fundamentally are as people. We can learn to
   let the people we are today fade away, like a suit that no longer
   fits. We can allow ourselves to effortlessly slip into our new
   selves.

Who never know who you’re going to be.
