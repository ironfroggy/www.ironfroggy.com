Along the side of my blog, for many years. I've had a section called "Top Articles". I don't remember when I put it there, but I know that it included all of the most popular posts I had written at the time and I wanted to make them more prominent. They were obviously popular topics people wanted to find. These were the things I was writing about that people found most interesting or useful.

   I haven't thought a lot about this list for a few years, until I just
   noticed it today. Top ArticlesÂ is a time capsule. This was a snapshot
   of my interests and knowledge from a previous version of myself. It
   doesn't reflect me as well today. I'm equally interested in the
   things that no longer worth keeping on that list as I am of the
   things that are still very important to me.

   I'll make a point to clean things up around here. What was on that
   list so long ago?

   Of no surprise, I had a number of posts about Python which still draw
   a lot of new readers to this day.

| And at that time I was spending a lot of time helping people on
  programming forums, especially IRC. I tried to help explain how people
  can better reach out for the help they need.

  I was also starting to focus a little more broadly on how people learn
  to code and what we can do better.

   I was starting to write less about programming itself and more about
   managing the world of building projects. My focus was also starting
   to broaden from just syntax and code to what we're delivering to the
   user and what they're going to do with it. Signs of the holistic
   approach to building software that I try to take these days already
   forming so long ago.

      This blog was started in January of 2007. That's over seven and a
      half years ago, nearly as old as my son, who is a third grader.
      I'm sure the focus and breadth of my writing has changed since
      then, as have my opinions and focus. I'm sure over the next seven
      years they'll continue to do so, and I hope over that time I'll
      continue to write about it all.
