And, completely, I support that. And I'm glad for the wide support from others I see from that. We should support women in the Atheist community, and gays and bisexuals and the transgendered among us. And those outside of us, who are still marginalized even by religions they're a part of. We should support people of color, and the poor, and immigrants and single mothers more. Intersectionality is the word.</span></div><div style="background-color: white; line-height: 18.479999542236328px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br />I came across this idea first from&nbsp;<a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2012/08/21/why-atheism-plus-is-good-for-atheism/" style="text-decoration: none;">Greta Christina's post</a>.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="background-color: white; line-height: 18.479999542236328px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br />But, I don't think we need a label for this. That doesn't mean there isn't a reason for it, and maybe I should phrase it "I don't think we should need it.", so let me explain.</span></div><div style="background-color: white; line-height: 18.479999542236328px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="background-color: white; line-height: 18.479999542236328px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><i>...the rest of the <a href="http://thatliberalextremist.blogspot.com/2014/10/on-atheism-plus.html">post continues at That Liberal Extremist</a>.
