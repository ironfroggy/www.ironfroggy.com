   News came out of Mozilla that was of zero surprise to me, and many
   others, but did upset and surprise a great number of people. Mozilla,
   long time champion of a free and open web, is backing down on their
   stance to never incorporate the new DRM mechanisms in HTML5 into
   Firefox. Firefox will officially support blackbox DRM’ed content
   played back exclusively through closed source components.

   The new DRM support in HTML5 has been inevitable for some time. It is
   not inevitable because DRM is a good thing (it is not) or because the
   media companies are too powerful to fight (they are not). The
   inevitability of this beachhead was all due to two names on the draft
   authorship list: a developer from Google (the company that brings you
   the Chrome browser) and a developer from Microsoft (of Internet
   Explorer). When this DRM spec was first proposed it was obviously
   inevitable because it did not come from outside, but from within, and
   with a foothold in two of the most popular browsers in the world. It
   was obvious that from Day One both would support these new
   capabilities, that Netflix (also a co-author) and many other media
   sites would utilize it, and that users would be left with either a
   severely limited web experience or the option to leave Firefox
   behind.

   Mozilla tried to make a stand and it was entirely admirable.

   It was not, however, practical even for a second.

   DRM can be beaten. DRM can be made irrelevant. DRM can even be made
   detrimental to the very media corporation profits that drove it into
   existence in the first place! This is not the day when these
   statements can be made in the present tense. The fight we have before
   us is a long-haul fight.

   Had Firefox been kept out of this game entirely, it could not
   participate in that fight at all. We could all see the writing on the
   wall when Mozilla so valiantly tried to make their stand. Had they
   continued, we would have seen them launch (I’m sure of this) some
   campaign to push DRM free video portals as alternatives, to showcase
   that now all video content requires these measures. They would have
   been laughably limited and done little more than to showcase the
   (current) need to give users access to the content they actually do
   care about.

   That is why, for the time being, this was the right move.

   Firefox will continue to allow users to access Netflix and Hulu and
   Youtube content that requires silly measures to make content owners
   comfortable. Staying in the fight today will allow Mozilla to
   contribute to the fight for a long time coming, and I do think this
   will be a long time fight.

I just don’t know what that fight will entail.
