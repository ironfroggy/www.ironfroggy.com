   Day 7 I took a deliberate break, as a gamble. I was feeling some
   strain and I needed to show myself that I can take a break when I
   need it, so I spent the evening watching a movie with my son (Honey,
   I Shrunk the Kids) instead of writing that evening.

   I decided to catch up starting this weekend, but slowly instead of
   trying to do enormous days that would just kill me. 2000 words a day
   is enough to catch up over the next week without pushing myself too
   hard, and I do think I can do that. I did 2200 words on November 8th,
   and they were good words and a scene I was happy with. I'm feeling
   good.

   There are a lot of questions about how to get through some of the
   "rising action" that needs to happen between now and the planned
   summit of my story, but I'm feeling ever more confident that I can
   get there. Not just that I can get there, but that I can get there
   through an engaging story that someone might enjoy reading. I'm
   really feeling good about this.

   So, plans can change. You need to adapt if what you're doing isn't
   working. Writing advice from a recent\ `NaNoWriMo
   update <http://nanowrimo.org/updates/10301>`__\ is very fitting.
