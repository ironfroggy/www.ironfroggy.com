<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Day 7 I took a deliberate break, as a gamble. I was feeling some strain and I needed to show myself that I can take a break when I need it, so I spent the evening watching a movie with my son (<i>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</i>) instead of writing that evening.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">I decided to catch up starting this weekend, but slowly instead of trying to do enormous days that would just kill me. 2000 words a day is enough to catch up over the next week without pushing myself too hard, and I do think I can do that. I did 2200 words on November 8th, and they were good words and a scene I was happy with. I'm feeling good.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">There are a lot of questions about how to get through some of the "rising action" that needs to happen between now and the planned summit of my story, but I'm feeling ever more confident that I can get there. Not just that I can get there, but that I can get there through an engaging story that someone might enjoy reading. I'm really feeling good about this.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">So, plans can change. You need to adapt if what you're doing isn't working. Writing advice from a recent <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/updates/10301">NaNoWriMo update</a> is very fitting.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">It is not important that you stay the same writer you are now</span></blockquote></div>
