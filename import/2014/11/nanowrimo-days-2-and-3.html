<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Yesterday I did my best to make up some of the time I lost in an opening day that knocked some of my pride out. I wrote a lot slower than I had anticipated on Saturday and I didn't expect that to change, so I took advantage of a Sunday with little plans to take up my time and had three writing sessions.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">I wrote around each meal, so three through the day. My son took it upon himself to join me for two of them, and he got a little distracted when he learned what text formatting was in his word processor (Google Docs) but setup upon himself a goal of three sentences a day as a minimum, and more if he more ideas. This is a good goal for an eight year old writer.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">There is a line I have to walk where I'm not encouraging him enough on one side and I'm just trying to push him because I want to share writing with him on the other. He didn't want to write on Monday, but I let it slide because of the balance I need to keep on that line.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">I ended yesterday above schedule, but I'm basically on par today with 5058 words on a day when 5000 would be the goal. 58 words over barely count, so keeping ahead is going to mean a chance of pace. My plan is a 30 minute writing session in the morning after my morning pages, which can hopefully help me hit 2000 words every day.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Today I sought out a piece in my reading queue on writing and I found an interview with Stephen King on writing first lines. This is good, because I don't have a first line yet.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Open a book in the middle of a dramatic or compelling situation, because  right away you engage the reader's interest.
