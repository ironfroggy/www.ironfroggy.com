   Yesterday I did my best to make up some of the time I lost in an
   opening day that knocked some of my pride out. I wrote a lot slower
   than I had anticipated on Saturday and I didn't expect that to
   change, so I took advantage of a Sunday with little plans to take up
   my time and had three writing sessions.

   I wrote around each meal, so three through the day. My son took it
   upon himself to join me for two of them, and he got a little
   distracted when he learned what text formatting was in his word
   processor (Google Docs) but setup upon himself a goal of three
   sentences a day as a minimum, and more if he more ideas. This is a
   good goal for an eight year old writer.

   There is a line I have to walk where I'm not encouraging him enough
   on one side and I'm just trying to push him because I want to share
   writing with him on the other. He didn't want to write on Monday, but
   I let it slide because of the balance I need to keep on that line.

   I ended yesterday above schedule, but I'm basically on par today with
   5058 words on a day when 5000 would be the goal. 58 words over barely
   count, so keeping ahead is going to mean a chance of pace. My plan is
   a 30 minute writing session in the morning after my morning pages,
   which can hopefully help me hit 2000 words every day.

   Today I sought out a piece in my reading queue on writing and I found
   an interview with Stephen King on writing first lines. This is good,
   because I don't have a first line yet.

      Open a book in the middle of a dramatic or compelling situation,
      because right away you engage the reader's interest. This is what
      we call a "hook," and it's true, to a point.
