   The programming language researcher Jonathan Edwards is, honestly,
   one of my heroes. He published his Future Programming Manifesto which
   outlines principles guiding his work, and I've re-read it a few
   times. I want to post it here just because I believe in these points
   so much but you absolutely must\ `read the full
   guidelines <http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=893>`__\ at length and
   let them sink in.

-  Inessential complexity is the root of all evil
-  Complexity is cumulative cognitive load
-  Our institutions, culture, and psychology all foster complexity
-  Think outside the box
-  Programming for the people
-  Simplicity first; performance last
-  Disciplined design evaluation

| and just for a teaser of the full thing:

   We are not doing Science. We are doing Design
