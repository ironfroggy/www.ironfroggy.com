      I did not love the words I put on the page the last time I sat
      down to write. 

   ..

      I’m trying to process this feeling and I think that appropriately
      I’ll do so through writing even more. Maybe I’ll love these words,
      or maybe they’ll hurt like a toe stubbed on the sofa. Is this
      really coming out of my head? I can spend days or weeks “meaning
      to write” but never finding the time (what a lie) and when I
      finally sit down and get a measly few hundred words down, this is
      what I get? It doesn’t seem fair. It doesn’t seem right that
      anything so useless would be all my reward for getting my shit
      together and spending a whole half an hour in front of the
      keyboard.

      Obviously, I need a reality check. 

   ..

      There are going to be \ *so many *\ more bad writing sessions. I’m
      going to write\ *so many *\ crappy paragraphs, useless pages, and
      awful chapters that just have to be thrown away. I’m going to have
      to, if I want to get to the good ones. I’m going to pull a desert
      out from my finger tips and hope with every tug an oasis is found.
      I’ll drink the little haven dry immediately, and I’ll be
      surrounded by gritty unpleasant sand again to trudge through. I’ll
      be diligent. I’ll march on. I’ll find the next oasis. 

      I’ll never know when it will come.
