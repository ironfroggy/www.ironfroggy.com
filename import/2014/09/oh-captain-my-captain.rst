I know of you, but can I say I know you?
Every time I see you, you wear a mask.
Every time I see you, there is a new mask.
I think you wore those masks so skillfully,
But I have come to notice them slightly askew.
I see with each mask a glimpse of the hidden face,
And I see among all the masks similarities.
You have taught me much in my life.
As a child you taught me fun and carefree joy.
When coming of age, you taught me of identity.
As an adult, you taught me of freeful dignity.
I mourned your loss with those who shared sorrow,
And my pain is not unique but it shouldnâ€™t be,
Because the difference you have made is vast.
The world may mourn your loss in sorrow,
But we will always remember your name with joy.
In memory of Robin Williams
