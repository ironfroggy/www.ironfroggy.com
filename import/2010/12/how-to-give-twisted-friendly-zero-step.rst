Zero-Step: n. The first impression and actions of a user's exposure to a
new tool, before actual research and use of the details.
I'm not as involved with or using Twisted as much I'd like, but I still
pay attention and I care about the project. I understand its strengths
and its weaknesses and I want to see it used in more cases where it is
the best tool for the job. There is a obvious and recently publicized
problem with Twisted and the Zero-Step.
Why do people go to twistedmatrix.com for the first time?
Usually, it probably isn't to read the documentation or start
investigating open bug reports. First time visitors are looking to solve
a problem and the first thing that has to be impressed on them is if
Twisted actually solves that problem. This is actually a really big
problem in this case, because there are so many problems it can solve.
How do you present that image without boring lists of functionality and
supported protocols?
The most obvious use-case for Twisted is probably for HTTP setups, while
another important angle is probably people looking to test it out with
something simple and pointless like an IRC bot. While an IRC bot is
boring to a lot of us already familiar with the details, it is a very
common introduction people make for network programming.
What kind of timeout can we expect on their willingness to read before
getting the gist of it?
Not much, probably. Certainly, it takes more upfront investment in
personal time and energy than a lot of people care to make. It would
have to be obvious and prominent at the front page how to get a quick
introduction that gives you an idea if Twisted is what you're looking
for. The most obvious section you'll see now is What is Twisted? with
one link in bold that will stand out to a new visitor, sending them to
the Twisted Core Documentation. This is a really boring looking page,
with no styling, lots of parts with names people won't understand, and
an 11-part finger tutorial. This is not an approachable presentation.
The whole section needs replaced with something more eye catching and it
needs to lead to a new section of the site that exists just to impress
those new eyes. "If you want to get started with Twisted, the first
thing you should do is read the\ `Twisted Core
Documentation <http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/index.html>`__\ "
istoo much to ask new comers who have no idea if this is what they're
looking for and often don't have time to read that much documentation to
make the call, because they've already got a problem with a deadline or
simply have a limited amount of free time to pursue the interest on
their own. I think there can be a sentiment to just let these facts weed
out the less motivated, but it serves to cut out too many who would do
the project some good.
How can you get the greatest number of readers to continue interest in
Twisted with only one page view to convince them?
If you can fit it in without scrolling, then even better. Being lax
enough to allow some scrolling to grok the whole introduction, can you
get people intrigued enough to sit through more complete readings of the
docs, put up with difficulties getting started and adjusting their way
of thinking, and dealing with a relatively steep learning curve?
*In Part 2, I'll continue my previous post about Django influencing the
presentation of Twisted. Hopefully we can come up with some ideas to
make the approach to Twisted less frightening for new users.*
