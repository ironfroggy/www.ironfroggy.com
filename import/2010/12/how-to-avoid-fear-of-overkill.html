I have heard it about Python and things in the standard library, about jQuery, about Django and Twisted, and about any language that isn't C. The common thread here is someone feeling that, as they are not using every or many parts of a tool, they should not use it for the one or two things it could be useful for. These people suffer from the Fear of Overkill.<br /><br />I can summarize the argument against this very simply.<br /><br />It would be overkill for you to <i>write</i>&nbsp;the entire tool for the one or two uses you have. It would also be overkill for you to write a bad version of the one or two uses, when you could use what already exists. It is <i>not</i>&nbsp;overkill to simply <b>use what has already been provided to you</b>.</div><data:post.title></data:post.title>
