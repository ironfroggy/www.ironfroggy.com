   Something I read today in a Javascript forum gave me pause to think
   about broader attitudes in developer tools and libraries.

..

   I love jQuery, but if this is all you want to do, jQuery is
   overkill. 

   Javascript libraries are great if you want to do a lot of things, or
   one really complicated thing, but if you're just doing something
   small and simple, just write the javascript code.

   I respectfully disagree.

   Of course, people say this about a lot of other libraries and I
   defend against this stance in, more or less, all of these cases. I
   have heard it about Python and things in the standard library, about
   jQuery, about Django and Twisted, and about any language that isn't
   C. The common thread here is someone feeling that, as they are not
   using every or many parts of a tool, they should not use it for the
   one or two things it could be useful for. These people suffer from
   the Fear of Overkill.
   I can summarize the argument against this very simply.
   It would be overkill for you to *write* the entire tool for the one
   or two uses you have. It would also be overkill for you to write a
   bad version of the one or two uses, when you could use what already
   exists. It is *not* overkill to simply **use what has already been
   provided to you**.
