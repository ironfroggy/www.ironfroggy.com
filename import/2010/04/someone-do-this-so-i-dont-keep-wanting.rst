| I'd like to say it is for lack of time, but the blame is equally (at
  least) on the shoulders of a lack of motivation. This is the blame for
  why all these little ideas never get made. Here are a few things I
  would love to do/make, but would even more so love for someone else to
  have already done. There are things I really want to build, because I
  am excited about building them. There are other things I really want
  to build, because I am excited about *using* them. For the second
  group, I'd just as soon find that someone else will, is, or already
  has built it.

Del.icio.us Bookmark Post Generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| I'd like to collect and blog the links I find throughout the day, but
  I can't find a good non-manual way to do it. The method I blogged
  previously didn't really pan out, unfortunately. I want a web app that
  I can give my `del.icou.us <http://del.icou.us/>`__ account and have
  link posts generated for me, with options.

-  Minimum and maximum links to include in a post
-  Minimum and maximum time to pass between posts
-  Email, auto-post to Blogger/Wordpress APIs, or manually generate

Todo Sync
~~~~~~~~~

| We have lots of places where we track things to do, between our bug
  trackers and websites like `Remember the
  Milk <http://rememberthemilk.com/>`__ and
  `Evernote <http://evernote.com/>`__. I'd love a tool that can collect
  and synchronize these in controlled ways. I want bugs assigned to me
  added to RTM and I want checkboxes from Evernote notes added, as well.

User-Script Online Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It makes sense, as low impact as userscripts are, they should be
editable and forkable on the sites that host them. This sounds simple,
right? I started to write this, but just haven't found the time to
finish it. Do you?
