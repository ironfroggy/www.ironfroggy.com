      I'm trying to "get all my ducks in a row" as the saying goes. I've
      got a lot of standing projects, some personal and some
      professional and many straddling a line between those two.

      As part of the process of figuring out what I need to do, I need
      to figure out what I want to do. I've got a broad range of things
      demanding my time and a broader range of things I'm wishing I
      could put my time to. There simply isn't enough of me to go
      around.

      I see so many others around and they seem so much more productive
      than me. Where do you find the time? How do you do it? I've
      obviously got some missing element I need to find.

      The plan at hand is a simple set of actions.

   -  Track my time 24 hours a day. This keeps me focused, especially
      for non-billable hours.
   -  Decide on each standing project if I can do anything. If not now,
      archive it. If never, delete it.
   -  Write every morning. Write more whenever I have something on my
      mind.

      There are things I wish I had time for that I never will. I never
      sketch any more and I haven't picked up the guitar in a decade.
      I'll focus on what I can accomplish so that I don't have time to
      feel bad about the things I cannot accomplish.
