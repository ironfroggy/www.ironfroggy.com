I have been making an attempt to record my day. I'm doing this for a
number of reasons. I want to know how my moods change through the day,
when I'm happy or not, when I'm feeling motivated, and when I'm being
productive.

   To facilitate this, I have a spreadsheet on Google Docs called "Daily
   Me" and I've built two sheets. One tracks daily and one tracks
   hourly. This is what I'm tracking.

   Daily:

.. container::

   -  When I wake up
   -  Weight
   -  How many of my morning exercises did I do?
   -  How many of the things I want to do every day did I do? This
      includes morning pages, sketching, picking up my guitar, reading,
      and writing.
   -  When I go to sleep

      Hourly:

   .. container::

      -  Mood
      -  What am I doing right now?
      -  1-10 scales on how happy, depressed, energetic, and motivated I
         feel at the moment
      -  "Productive" which I mark yes or no. I consider being
         "productive" doing whatever it is I feel I should be doing
         right then. This is the thing I try to keep in the green and
         use everything else to improve.

         You might think this could get disruptive. I don't have to do
         it hourly, so that is only a maximum. I use KAlarm, and your OS
         has or can have another app for reminders. Every hour it
         launches a Spreadsheet Form in a new window to let me enter
         things and get back to whatever I'm doing.

         I use this for other daily things. It asks me every day if I've
         done my exercises, tells me when to check my e-mail (not so I
         remember to, but so I don't check it too often), and other
         things.

         Overall, I find this is helpful. I like being kept honest, even
         if its just with myself. I pay more attention to if I'm doing
         what I should be doing at any given moment, but I don't have to
         put too much into it and get distracted from those very things.
         Later, I can look back and find patterns. Even without looking
         into it deeply, filling it out and thinking about what's going
         on and how its affecting my day to day helps me improve my
         understanding of myself and how to do more with every day of my
         life.
