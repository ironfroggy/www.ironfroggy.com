For years we've been so in love with Google. Don't deny it, a part of
you smirks or even cringes when you see a colleuge searching with Yahoo
or MSN. You feel better than "those hotmail kids" because you are
@gmail.com. Google is at the forefront of all that is technologically
good and righteous, and we just can't get enough.
I think I've had enough.
Why am I using Microsoft's Live Earth instead of Google Maps/Local (they
can't seem to draw a good line between the conjoined services)? Live's
Image search is enough to make Google Image look like a cheap gallery on
a geocities page. YouTube consistantly provides better content than
Google Video, whose saving grace is the large video size by default and
that you can rent Night of the Living Dead. I'm desperately looking for
something to replace Google Reader for my feed consumption, and eagerly
awaiting Divmod to reopen Quotent so I can pay them to not have to use
GMail anymore. Google recently launched their long-rumored calender
service, and I've been using it but am continually frustrated by the
interface's inconsistancies.
The various things that lead me to realize more and more that Google
isn't so fantastic have also opened my eyes to an interesting
revelation: their web-app interfaces are pretty poor. Simple is good, so
they seem to drop features just to make it look clean, but end up with a
stump of what could have been. And, I'm continually tired of the lack of
interconnectiveness with all the Google app's that I use. Blogger,
GMail, Reader, Calender, and its like I'm using them all from seperate
venders.
Google, what are you paying all those PhD's to spend the 80% of their
time on? At the rate Live is improving and companies like 37signals are
tossing out great web-apps, you're going to fade away and be lucky if
you salvage a place in the world as a mediocre advertisement channel.
