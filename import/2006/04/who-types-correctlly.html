Even the most computer-literate geeks usually do not use the "proper" methods of typing. I've not used it since keyboarding class in Jr High, myself. I am wondering, do you use the proper methods or not? Do you rest on the home row and hit the space with a thumb and never an index? I'm also wondering, has anyone taken the plunge and tried to relearn their typing skills after years of doing it the "wrong" way?
