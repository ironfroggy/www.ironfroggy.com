Just wanted to quickly link to the Synergy project, which I'm now using.
Wow, it is so cool. Anyone who has multiple systems at their desk or
sits a laptop beside their desktop's monitor should really take a look
at this. Dual screen is one level of cool, but being able to move my
mouse across multiple screens running multiple operating systems is a
blast, and productive too. Copy and paste and keyboard and mouse can all
be shared. Now, I'm very interested in if windows could be dragged
between the screens with this one day...
