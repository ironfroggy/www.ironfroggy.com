I love that I can watch TV on the internet. Adult Swim's
`Fix <http://www.adultswim.com/adultswimfix/index.jsp>`__ is especially
a well visited destination for me. However, I do have a problem with
them. One and all, in my expirience, they forget what radio stations and
television channels have trained us for all our lives: never reach for
the remote until you know what's on next. When one show is over, the
familiar feeling of "hey, look what's next" is a nice way to relax in
front of the TV, because its already on its way and you don't have to do
a damn thing for it. All the video distributions I've used across the
internet, however, make me request each and every show or clip or
whatever, and simply stop when the current one ends. Why can't I sit
back and enjoy the show, without knowing what it is?
