<span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-family: times new roman;">A lot of work has been going on with the Python AST and being able to manipulate it for more runtime uses. This is a generalized suggestion for something we could do in the Twisted community to utilize this.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman;">Given a simple function like this:</span></span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;"><br /><pre><br />   def processPage(url):<br />       d = getPage(url)<br />       d.addCallback(cb_processPage)<br />       d.addErrback(eb_processPage)<br />   def cb_processPage(page):<br />       print page<br />   def eb_processPage(error):<br />       print "Could not load page. Error: ", error<br /></pre><br /><span style="font-family:times new roman;">We write like that, but what we really mean, and just need to express in a more difficult manner, is:<br /><span style="font-family:courier new;"><br /><pre><br />   def processPage(url):<br />       try:<br />           print getPage(url)<br />       except LoadError, e:<br />           print "Could not load page. Error: ", e<br /></pre><br /><span style="font-family:times new roman;">What I want to know, is can we take the second example and process the AST branch to produce the first example? Lets step through and see how it would work. First of all, we need to know what is deferred. A simple way would be to check every function return and determine if it is a deferred, but there may be more efficent methods we can discover later. For any possibly deferred call, the expression it is a part of can be refactored out into its own function, as can the exception handler code. When a deferred is detected, the callbacks can be attached and if the operation is not deferred, the callbacks can be used directly. This might even bring about something slightly new: optionally deferred operations. Instead of using defer.succeed and such, returning a deferred could cause code to handle the deferred properly, which would otherwise act in a normal syncronous manner. Depending on just how the AST stuff progresses, maybe the returning of the deferred could trigger the inspection of the calling function to inject the deferred handling code, so only functions that ever get a deferred will need processing.</span><br /></span></span></span>
