I am on vacation. It is very, very nice.<br /><br />Even before this, things have been slow. On the edge of worryingly slow, but still not slow enough that I've had to fret over anything. I've been enjoying some relaxation and time with my growing baby boy and my beatiful wife.<br /><br />We've taken the holiday with her family and our friends in sunny North Carolina, where I have been enjoying warm, sunny weather to start my winter. I actually miss the cold.<br /><br />Although not much has happened externally, a lot has happened internally. I am using the down time to organize myself, my plans, and prepare movements forward for proper exploration of some plans I've had on the back burner for a while now.<br /><br />More of my time has been able to be spent on more recreational activities, as well, and that is nice. Reading has been lost to me for some time, and I've picked up a few books I've enjoyed. I plan to start another blog, which will be focused on reviews of literature developers, gamers, and other geeks will enjoy, but not necessarily literature about those topics. I want to bring other people in on this one, so if anyone is interested in reviewing good books, new or old, contact me (ironfroggy (ta) gmail (tod) com).<br /><br />Speaking of the holidays and recreation: I got a Wii! I've been loving it. I have the WiiSports that came with the system, and the new Zelda, but I actually play the WiiSports more, so far. It is so fun. I've been taking the system around to friends' houses and we all have sore arms from so much bowling, the funest game for multiple people and one controller (and maybe my favorite one besides that). Anyway, when I get some good online games, I can't wait to play against some others in the community.<br /><br />My Mii number is <span style="font-weight: bold;">3456 8115 5527 0431</span>.<br /><br />So far I can't bowl over a 175, the words "fowl ball" have lost all meaning, and I can sleep easier under the delusion that a higher score is better, even in golf. Zelda is slow going to start, but I'm enjoying it. Kind of obvious how it wasn't started as a Wii game, however. Most of the time the wiimote is just used to make a little fairy (with, so far, no mention in the game what-so-ever) fly around. And I can fish.<br /><br />I will possibly move away from blogspot soon. I need more flexability.
