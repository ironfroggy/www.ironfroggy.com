I am trying to improve and promote my media (reviews and such) and arts (writing and painting) blogs, so here is a bit of shameless self promotion.<br /><br /><a href="http://spiltmind.blogspot.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Spilt Mind</span></a> has some ramblings about my attempts at rejuvenating my creative side.<br /><br /><a href="http://mentaloutlash.blogspot.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mental Outlash</span></a> just got a review to the amazing <span style="font-style: italic;">Stranger Than Fiction</span>.<br /><br />Interested? Check them out. Otherwise, sorry to bother you. I want to keep these minimum. I should probably append some cross references to the end of the next post I write here.
