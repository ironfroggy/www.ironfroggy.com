| Since I have begun a career as a "professional web developer", I've
  thought that maybe I should come up with a personal web project for
  myself. I usually prefer non-web work for my own stuff, but the
  challenge to do really good things in the limitations of a webpage is
  pretty cool. So, what should I do? I've thought of some ideas, but I'm
  not sure which would be the best...

-  A virtual pet website, with actual interactivity with your pets, who
   will be driven by similated biochemestry and artificial neural
   networks, much like Creatures.
-  A web-based Python IDE, designed to be used by other applications or
   stand-alone.
-  An artificial neural network development suite as a webapp.
-  A waste-my-time website full of different web-based games you can
   play with other users anonymously (ie, no registration. just go and
   have fun.)

I dunno, I just need to have something of my own to spend some time on
now and again. Any thoughts on what sounds cool?
