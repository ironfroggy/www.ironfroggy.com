`Slashdot \| One In Two PCs Won't Run Vista's
Interface <http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/02/10/2137245>`__
But 100% of the OEMs' systems built specifically for Vista will run it
just fine, and who cares about anything else? Joe-user doesn't upgrade
windows, he buys a new computer. If you upgrade your OS yourself, you're
going to have a better graphics card, anyway, most likely.
Another thing I am tired of hearing about is claims of "Aero will burn
through my electric bill" and "Vista will kill my CPU with its fancy
GUI!", because it is all FUD. Moving more of the GUI processing off of
the CPU will improve overall system performance, user productivity, and
there is nothing forcing a hardware-based GUI to keep a frantic
framerate like any game.
Slashdot, you found me some great things, when I didn't know any better.
Now, you're mostly a source of things for me to get angry about and try
to correct.
