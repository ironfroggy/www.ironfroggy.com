RSS, Atom, and Feeds, oh my! All terms that get tossed around lately
more often than Dick Cheney hunting jokes on the Daily Show. In a world
of increasing information overload, feeds and aggregation are the
emerging solution to tackling the problem of "How do I deal with all
this stuff I could know?"
Like any new technology, feed syndication is not without its problems
and limitations, and I would like to bring up a limitation today: the
Web is more than a source of content, its a collection of interfactions
with that content, and feeds only syndicate the content, ignoring the
interaction.
Where is the syndication of interactivity to various web services? To
begin with, how about letting my news reader include all the commentary
to the article and allowing me to comment myself, without going to the
original website? As long as I'm getting new recipes every day, why
can't I just as easily (and, from the same place) submit my own? The web
was always meant as a two-way medium (the original web browser allowed
you to edit and repost pages you had access to), so if RSS is the
evolution of the web, it needs to bring interaction along with the
content.
