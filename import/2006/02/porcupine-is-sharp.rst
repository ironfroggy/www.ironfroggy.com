I caught wind of InnoScript's
`Porcupine <http://www.innoscript.org/content/view/41/2/>`__ realease,
today. They seemed to have done something pretty spiffy, even though
most of the work is done by XUL. It says it works on IE, as well as
Mozilla browsers, but I'm not sure how that works if its a XUL-based
system.
Everything in the demo is pretty responsive. The widgets are
full-featurse and intuitive, and they do everything you think they
should. The icon widget didn't select tho, or drag, but it
double-clicked. Column widths are draggable, tables are resortable, and
menus are quick. Its all very nice for a web app in JavaScript.
The whole time I looked around in the demo, I kept thinking to myself
how things like that could be done in Athena, and what is there to
support it today and what is missing that needs put in. The Divmod-guys
didn't seem opposed to that sort of thing.
