I caught wind of InnoScript's <a href="http://www.innoscript.org/content/view/41/2/">Porcupine</a> realease, today. They seemed to have done something pretty spiffy, even though most of the work is done by XUL. It says it works on IE, as well as Mozilla browsers, but I'm not sure how that works if its a XUL-based system.<br /><br />Everything in the demo is pretty responsive. The widgets are full-featurse and intuitive, and they do everything you think they should. The icon widget didn't select tho, or drag, but it double-clicked. Column widths are draggable, tables are resortable, and menus are quick. Its all very nice for a web app in JavaScript.<br /><br />The whole time I looked around in the demo, I kept thinking to myself how things like that could be done in Athena, and what is there to support it today and what is missing that needs put in. The Divmod-guys didn't seem opposed to that sort of thing.
