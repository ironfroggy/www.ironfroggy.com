This is a little late, because I've just been so busy, but my first
child, my son, Caelan Mathew Spealman, was born on May 13, 2006 at
11:45, just fifteen minutes before Mother's Day. It was the most amazing
expirience in my life, to go from a couple to a family as my son was
brought into this world, and honestly, this is just so cool! I can't
wait to teach him to program. I might be showing how much geek I am by
saying this, but my one-and-a-half week old son already has his own
computer.
