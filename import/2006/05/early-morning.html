Woke up at 6 AM, made a pot of coffee (with my patent pending technique of adding sugar and spices directly into the grounds before brewing), and caught up on my 600+ unread messages in GMail. Really made me want keyboard shortcuts for labelling, but the only Greasemonkey userscript I found didn't seem to work. It was supposed to let me hit the 'l' key and type in an autocompleted label name, but I did it the new old fashioned way in the end. Anyone know of such a userscript that does, in fact, work?
