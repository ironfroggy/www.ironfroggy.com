I would expect a titlebar-like control as such to be used to move a widget or window, and the X at its left to close the widget just enforces that thought, even tho the bar seems to serve no purpose. Pandora's people tell me it was for some very soon to come updates and that I would see why soon.</p>  <p>So, this morning I see they updated the interface again, and there are auto-appearing controls to vote on songs instead of clicking for the menu on each song. That means I will almost never ever see that popup. Is that what they were talking about? Am I missing something?<br/> </p>  <p/><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">technorati tags:<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pandora" rel="tag">pandora</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/music" rel="tag">music</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/userinterface" rel="tag">userinterface</a></p><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com" target="_new" title="Flock">Flock</a></p></div>
