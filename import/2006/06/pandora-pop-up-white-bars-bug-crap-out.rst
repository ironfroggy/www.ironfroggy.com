   So, they added this weird white-bar to top top of pop-up options, and
   I wrote them to complain because I find it very ugly and unintuitive.
   I would expect a titlebar-like control as such to be used to move a
   widget or window, and the X at its left to close the widget just
   enforces that thought, even tho the bar seems to serve no purpose.
   Pandora's people tell me it was for some very soon to come updates
   and that I would see why soon.

   | So, this morning I see they updated the interface again, and there
     are auto-appearing controls to vote on songs instead of clicking
     for the menu on each song. That means I will almost never ever see
     that popup. Is that what they were talking about? Am I missing
     something?
