   `Flock â€” The web browser for you and your
   friends <http://flock.com/>`__
   So this Firefox-based browser is pretty cool. It integrates
   del.icio.us, Flickr, and blogging. It seems to be strongly related to
   Yahoo!

   | I'll probably use this for all my casual browsing, keeping Firefox
     around for development, only.
