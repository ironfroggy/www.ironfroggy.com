This is exactly what we need to convince those people still <a href="http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2006/09/why-johnny-can-code.html">hanging on to BASIC</a>.<br /><br />I don't know if its from my suggestion, although I got a personal e-mail from Fuzzy on the <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2006_10_07.shtml#e487">announcement</a>, but its here and its free and its exactly what I need for the many interested people I am trying to bring Python to.
