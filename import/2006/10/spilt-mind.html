I won't be able to use it much, but if I have the need to write something and get some creativity flowing (it helps improve your coding mind, as well), I will be posting those writings or art pieces to a new blog I created, <a href="http://spiltmind.blogspot.com/">Spilt Mind</a>. So easy to make a new blog, and I keep getting distraught over my lack of writing and painting over the last year or two. This is a much needed outlet, however much it gets used.
