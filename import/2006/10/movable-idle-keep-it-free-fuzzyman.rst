Several weeks ago, I contacted `Michael Foord (aka,
Fuzzyman) <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/>`__ about the idea of a simpler,
slimmed version of his Movable Python distribution for those interested
in the language, and often not computer literate enough to put up with
all the different components you need for any decent development
environment. This is exactly what we need to convince those people still
`hanging on to
BASIC <http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2006/09/why-johnny-can-code.html>`__.
I don't know if its from my suggestion, although I got a personal e-mail
from Fuzzy on the
`announcement <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2006_10_07.shtml#e487>`__,
but its here and its free and its exactly what I need for the many
interested people I am trying to bring Python to.
