I've been working up to this for quite some time now, but things have
begun in motion that will cause some big changes coming my way, which
will probably be reflected in the quanitity and quality of posts here.
In short, there will be more of them and they'll be better, because I'll
have more time and more to draw from.
I closed my first large contract, which will allow me to quit the dayjob
and work full-time from home. This is fantastic timing, and freightening
timing: I have a child on the way due right around the end of this
project. So I'm taking something of a risk here, but things a already
lined up to make sure we're secure for enough time to handle any
misfortunes that come our way, and it will be fantastic to work from
home instead of going away to work each day, when the baby arrives and I
won't want to leave. Ever.
These changes will give me more time to focus on things going on in the
communities, and comment and theorize and contribute more to everything
going on. I'll probably be taking my hand at some kind of personal
project, which I'm narrowing in on and will likely talk about in the
near future, when I decide on some things and maybe get some funding
(might need to make a call to that Rich Uncle everyone always talks
about).
Wish me luck, everyone.
