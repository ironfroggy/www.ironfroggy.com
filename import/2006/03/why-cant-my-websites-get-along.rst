Today, I did something pretty normal for this day and age, but I had to
do it in contortions to get around limitations driven solely by greed,
not technology. All I wanted to do was read a page of reviews from
Google Reader, find the books on Amazon, and send the wish list to
someone on my GMail contact list.
Now, under nicer conditions, this would have been really easy. The books
would have been automatically highlighted and assoicated with the
entries on Amazon, and actions tied to them for adding to my wish list,
and the form at Amazon would let me pick an address from my GMail
contact list. Why doesn't this work already? I'm not saying I expect it
to right now, I'm actually seriously asking: What needs to happen for
this to work?
