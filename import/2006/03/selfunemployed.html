Coinciding with my entry into self employment, I have decided to start a small webcomic, by suggestion of a good friend. I rushed the first strip, doing it in about an hour, but I wanted to start it on the same day as my first day working for myself. It is entitled "SelfUnEmployment" and I hope you will enjoy it. I was hoping to start up something more creative, as I have ignored my writing and painting for far too long. This is a good way to exercise those lost talents, again.
