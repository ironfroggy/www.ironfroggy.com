| Yes, I do believe a good developer has to know `more than a handful of
  languages <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages>`__.
  `Ten <http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2016415,00.asp>`__ sure is
  an arbitrary number to pick, but whatever!

| Read the list, I don't want to recap it.
| Of the ten languages listed, I don't find three and a half of them
  compelling choices.

-  C#
-  Python
-  JavaScript
-  AJAX (this is the half)

| Some people might find that an odd list. If you know a little about
  any of the languages, you might find it even odder. If you know a lot
  about the languages, you'll have no trouble agreeing, I feel
  confident.
| C# is largely what Java should have been. Python is, of course, a
  fantastic language for most purposes. JavaScript is essential for web
  work, and web work is essential for getting the rent paid, these days.
  AJAX, much the same.
| C# and JavaScript get some crap from the OSS communities. People look
  down their noses at C#, having such a distaste for all things wearing
  the brand of Gates. JavaScript can be an ugly,
  incompatable-with-anything mess, but it can be elegant and powerful,
  as well. Both languages can play very nicely with Python, via good web
  services and toolkits.
| Python gets some cruft from the communities who normally work with C#
  and JavaScript. C# developers are often not open source fans, and they
  don't know what these weird hippies are talking about, because Visual
  Basic is just fine. JavaScript users often work exclusively in the web
  industry, where languages like PHP reign supreme. Python and PHP do
  not clash, so the JavaScript world hasn't had a great past with
  respect to Python. A lot of this is changing with the work being done
  at Mozilla getting Python support into the platform, adopting Python
  features for JavaScript 2.0, and PyPy being able to compile a python
  interpreter to JavaScript (crazy!).
| And, quickly, why the other 6 1/2 languages just don't make the cut,
  or under what circumstances you might justify learning PHP, for
  example.

-  PHP
   So many of us hate it, but we work with it day in and day out.
   Sometimes you hate what you do, but you the bills it pays. Do many
   people enjoy PHP? No, but many of those people get paid for it.
-  Perl
   Very little perl these days is used off the web, and if you don't
   have the freedom to use something fun like Python, then PHP is even a
   more fitting choice than Perl.
-  Ruby and Ruby on Rails
-  Ruby on Rails isn't really a language, unless you buy into the idea
   that Ruby allows for use as a DSL engine. Ruby was around for a long
   time with no fan real fanbase, until Rails stole the scene and we are
   largely just waiting for the tidal wave to subside. Ruby isn't a
   terrible language, but I find it odd and there is little weight in a
   language that is effective carried by a single product.
-  Java
   The promise this language once showed has waned just in time to see
   Sun almost get the picture before its flame is extinguished. The
   niche Java fit is filled nicely with languages like Python and Ruby.
   There is a long held stubborn view in the Java world that all things
   must be Java. Look at their toolkits written entirely in Java, and
   even prefering low-level work done in Java, rather than wrap existing
   libraries. Much of this is in the name of portability, but in the end
   it just means that I have to wait longer for Eclipse to load than it
   took my machine to boot up in the first place.
-  VB.Net
   I have not used the .Net versions of Visual Basic, but its ancestor
   is not a fun thing to live with. Even given its improvements (so I
   hear), it looses a lot of its weight anymore.
   These statements should be taken with salt, because I haven't worked
   with VB.Net, but here they are anyway. Being a .Net language, it
   shouldn't matter what language you use, so long as it utilizes the
   CLR. That means you could even use C# or Python to write the code for
   Excel and Access, which was one day the only reason anyone had to
   touch Visual Basic. So with the advent of IronPython, and the myriad
   of languages that can take VB's place in any given project, where is
   the need for this language anymore?

  leaving.
