IGN has a case of split personality. On the one hand, I don't have a new enough version of Flash installed for Firefox on Linux to play their videos.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1723/1190/1600/IGN-wont-play-video.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1723/1190/320/IGN-wont-play-video.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>On the other hand, if I want to watch some advertising, they wouldn't dare to stop me from doing what I wanna do!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1723/1190/1600/IGN-video-advertising.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1723/1190/320/IGN-video-advertising.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>Why do so many sites think I don't have a new enough version? Is newer Flash better? No, but the company pays for new versions of Flash Studio anyway, and it exports by default to a newer version, so why bother to change it? Thats like a couple mouse clicks or something! Jeez.
