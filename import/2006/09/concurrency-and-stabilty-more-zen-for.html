In an unrelated action, I went to check on my older blog, which I thought of resurrecting for some non-development articles, and I found a draft from a previous time the topic came up. I read it and was surprised to find that it proposes pretty much exactly what is being put on the table over this past weekend, with reference to walling off multiple interpreters in a single process and controlling messages past between them. The same technique scales for multiple cores, multiple processors, or multiple machines.<br /><br />I've decided to take the easy way out and just post the original draft with minor editing. I enjoy how spot on I ended up being with what is currently becomming an acceptable solution, it might seem. The original was written nearly a year ago. Does this mean my predictions are worth something? Decide for yourself!<br /><br /><span style="color:grey;">Concurrency is a hot topic on the Python mailing lists lately. There is a strong push to get some kind of native concurrency into Python, as the 3.0 branch is a great opportunity to do things that we can't otherwise do, as they would break old code. If we don't get something in now, particularly, something that can scale to hundreds of thousands of tasks and take advantage of multiple processors, we may not get a chance at what could be the best improvement of the language, until the next major version 4.0.<br /><br />A large part of the problems stems from how horrible an idea threads really are, as they are typically implemented. Threads, as the basic level, are just multiple pre-emptive tasks running with access to the same memory space. Doing this can be a boost for performance, but is hell to control properly. The threads must be syncronized to access their shared resources without clobbering each other. This can be done, but it is very error prone and very difficult to debug.<br /><br />The solutions seem to lean toward two ends of the spectrum: cooperative tasks and processes. With cooperative tasks, each concurrent unit runs until it says "OK, I'll let someone else run now", and so there is no explicit syncronization needed, because nothing happens without you knowing it, idealy.<br /><br />Processes, on the other hand, are basically threads without shared memory. These are the same way the concept of processes are implemted at an OS level. Some, including Guido van Russom, even think that is how we should go: multiple system processes communicating via pipes and sockets.<br /><br />What I propose is a process implementation with python itself. This would offer a lightweight process execution, where each process would consist of a thread of execution and an "object space". Each thread would only be able to access objects within this space. Communication would occure through channels between processes, which can be used like generators (gen.send(10), for example). I've created a basic implemenation, available on my webserver, here.<br /><br />With my basic demo, you can create object spaces, each with their own global and local dictionaries. There is no real protection, but it shows how it would work and offers an idea of how it would be used if we had real protected object spaces. You can run a function in a space with the run method, which takes a resonse function first, which is called when the the function returns and will be passed the called functions return value. If a function is already executing, the request is queued until its turn.</span><br /><br />I need to look around and find that demo/prototype code. I barely remember writing it, but I remember being pleased with the results. I'll look around and resurrect it. Perhaps it will serve as an interesting proof of concept for a possible solution to some of our concurrency problems. I wish I could put more work into a solution now, but at the moment I have little practicle use for concurrency of this type. Maybe in a while I can find justification to spend time on it.
