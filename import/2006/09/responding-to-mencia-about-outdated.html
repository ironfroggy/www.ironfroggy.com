It was a rerun, of course, but I don't get to watch the show regularly, although I am a fan.<br /><br />Carlos Mencia blasted some technologies he deemed as outdated and berated anyone who still uses them. I normally enjoy anything he does, having been a fan since before his currently popular show. However, I just had to say something how much I disagree with him on all but one of these technologies.<br /><br /><ul><li>Corded Phones<br />Yeah, I can't go without a cordless phone in a large-ish two story home, but sometimes you can't beat a five dollar phone that you can't loose between the couch cushions.</li><li>Nintendo 64<br />Retro gaming. I don't have to say more.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1723/1190/1600/111896_nintendo_64_controller_02.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1723/1190/320/111896_nintendo_64_controller_02.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /></li><li>Fax Machine<br />I hate fax machines, but the gas company won't let me e-mail them forms because, like it or not, its still easier than e-mail to get from deadtree to deadtree across long distances in a few minutes.</li><li>Pager<br />I've actually considered getting a pager instead of a cell phone. There are times you must be reachable, but must not be interupted. A device that takes away the desire to answer it, because you can't, can be a limitation from more than technology (its limitations original source) to a limitation for convinience. Technology can be a burden, and sometimes we must dial back to reclaim our lives.<br /></li><li>Cassette Tape<br />The one thing I'll agree on. I probably have a few tapes left laying around, but if you dont replace or migrate the content soon, they'll degrade and be lost anyway, so its time to leave them behind.</li></ul>Technology moves forward at ever-quickening paces, but if we turn our back on it, we loose more than just brick-sized car phones.
