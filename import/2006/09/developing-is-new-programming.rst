I've been saying this increasingly in debates and discussions over in
#python, where I frequent. It has to be something considered before, by
more intelligable people than myself, but I don't remember hearing such
a statement from anyone else.

The focus on the software world has drifted over the years from a focus
on programming to a focus on developing. The difference is import and
subtle. We can see this in the trend of popular software related books,
the evolution of practices and languages, and changing patterns in the
industry markets.
Books, Blogs, and Bantering
The landscape has changed on the kind of information pushed across the
board to techie types. Where as reading the official specification of
the C language was once a good software book, the best of today have no
mention or dependance on any particular language. The emphasis is on
books on development as can be applied broadly and generally, such as
the excellent Prefactoring.
This can also be seen on the blogscene and what was made available
online the most vigourously in the past. Resources are less and less
often references to the boring syntaxes and APIs of programming
languages and their libraries. More and more often, resources found talk
about testing practices, organizational details, mindsets, and the best
coffee to start your day coding.
Everything 37 Signals has to say is usually worth putting some thought
into absorbing, even though they use a language I dislike for various
reasons. They are the source of Ruby's recent spike in popularity, yet
it is rare to see them mentioning anything about on Signal vs Noise.
Instead, they opt for a kind of content that sometimes has nothing to do
with development at all, yet can be applied directly to every line of
code written in any language.
Is this an artifact of my personal interest and information source
drifting, or a wider trend of focus across the board?
