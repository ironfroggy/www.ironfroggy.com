IGN has a case of split personality. On the one hand, I don't have a new
enough version of Flash installed for Firefox on Linux to play their
videos.
|image0|\ On the other hand, if I want to watch some advertising, they
wouldn't dare to stop me from doing what I wanna do!
|image1|\ Why do so many sites think I don't have a new enough version?
Is newer Flash better? No, but the company pays for new versions of
Flash Studio anyway, and it exports by default to a newer version, so
why bother to change it? Thats like a couple mouse clicks or something!
Jeez.
