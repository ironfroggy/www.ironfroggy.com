I just found <a href="http://ulaluma.com/pyx/archives/2006/01/introducing_nev.html">NevowPavel</a>, Donovan Prestons year-long-so-far project that really takes everything Nevow has been reaching for to another level. JotLive has always been a pretty cool thing, but I honestly found it more gimmicky than anything else, and couldn't see myself finding it all that useful. Pavel, however, is jaw-dropping.<br /><br />Go and watch the webcast, as it is really the best way to see what this is capable of. I would love to play with this sometime soon, and maybe try my hand at creating some object types to play with in Pavel. I'm already formulating ideas to pitch to Donovan, including container types (which I imagine might be anticipated already) and possibly configurable handlers for incoming objects passed through portals within certain containers. Just think of the usefullness of a "Reviews Pending" space that had a portal configured to toss everything coming in into a container that listed everything for review. What about one-to-many portals? I don't know where they would go when followed from the one, but maybe they would only be one way. How about multi-part text objects? A lot of this is probably already in his own mind, but I can't wait to see where this progresses.
