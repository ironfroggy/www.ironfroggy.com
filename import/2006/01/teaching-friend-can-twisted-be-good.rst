A friend of mine has expressed an interest in learning to program, to
dive into the dream of creating the next great video game. I've decided
to tutor him, and teach him some things, as we make a small game for his
first jump into code. I've made a decision to go about this differently
than most.
I'm teaching him using `Twisted. <http://www.twistedmatrix.com/>`__
Twisted is an asycronous programming framework, and while it works great
for games, some would question my use of it on a newbie. I actually
think that the fresh mind might absorb the concepts easier than an
otherwise tainted programmer's mind. We'll see, I suppose.
