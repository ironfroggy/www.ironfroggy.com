|image0|\ I am running Windows 7 via VirtualBox, and I skipped Vista
completely, so some of my comments might also apply to Vista and thus be
outdated. Too bad.
You can probably expect a few other short pieces as I find something I
like and something I don't.
So, we see Internet Explorer here trying to help you out and tell you
the download seems safe. Of course, it also lets you report that the
download is, in fact, unsafe! This will no doubt be fed back into their
SmartScreen Filter service, and when enough users report something,
future users will be warned on downloading whatever bit of malware it
might be. What a great way to protect your users.
Now, the only obvious place to report the download is right here, in the
download dialog box, which disappears as soon as the download completes
and you can open or run it and actually discover anything threatening
about it to warn others about.
My Windows 7 review will eventually be the composite of many small
pieces. I'll build up a score card along the way, along with a table of
links between the series.
The Good: 0
The Bad: 1
