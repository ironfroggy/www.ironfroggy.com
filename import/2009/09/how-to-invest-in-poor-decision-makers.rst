I couldn't think of a better title that fit my "How To ..." pattern. The
point is, I wanted to make a response to the 37signals post that I found
a little harsh. Sure, if you were able to build your company up without
investors, that's a great thing! It doesn't make it a terrible thing to
get a boost in the early stages or give you a license to insult people
trying to pay the bills and put children through college.
Making great products is something a lot of us aspire to. Frankly, that
simply isn't all of us and there really are good developers out there
who are still only in it for the money. I don't know that is the case
with Mint.com, but neither does anyone over at 37signals. Belittling
them for taking a quick-cash option assumes a lot that may just be
completely wrong about the intentions.
Now with a chunk of change, maybe the founders are planning to jump ship
in a couple years and self-fund their real dreams.
On the matter of start-up investment itself, I do want to make some
comments. Full disclosure: I've never been involved in a venture backed
startup and I'm completely making this up from my own opinions about the
world!
Pretend I'm from your bank and call you back after a loan application.
You're taking out a small business loan to build an additional room in
your home for a new child. Everything looks good, and I've got a few
questions to go over before approving the loan.
"I'd like to make you an offer for 10% ownership in exchange for this
investment in your new venture," I begin.
"What the hell are you talking about?" you quizzically respond.
"We're talking about a significant investment in a potentially very
profitable new enterprise. This child may well become a doctor or lawyer
and if we're going to help with the initial costs of raising this from
the ground up, we all feel it is a reasonable request to share part
ownership and benefit from that share over the lifetime of its
profitability."
"Umm... I thought I'd pay the loan back. Plus interest, even. I don't
even think I would own the child myself, technically. This is very
strange..."
"Pay us back? A guarantee of interest accumulated as profit on our
contribution? We'd rather take a chance of nothing or you paying us
regularly for the rest of the child's entire lifespan. Oh, and all of
it's children, of course."

If we look at everything in our world from neutral eyes that aren't used
to our ways, things look weird. Does our investment model make sense, in
this industry or any other? Why are any initial investments not setup as
high-risk, high-interest loans, most likely with some initial grace
period to await profitability? Of course, we could make some comments
about the predatory loans and paying a cut of income for the rest of
one's life, but at least banks pretend that isn't the deal upfront.
It isn't like this isn't an unusual idea. People get small business
loans all the time. The tech sector seems to have skewed expectations
that lead to dangerous and strange arrangements for funding. Still, I
can't help but wonder if there are independent investors who would or do
take such a (relatively) altruistic route. I imagine something like a
traditional investment round, mandating some grace period of 1-2 years,
a repayment schedule requirement full reimbursement, and interest
accumulation that tapers off after repayment of the initial investment.
The basic foundation could be extended to view all initial players as
investors, be the investors of time or money. Invest your time to get a
business started, helped by monetary investments from others, and after
repaying yourself and those individuals the company becomes its own
entity. It is not burdened with paying out profit shares to you or
anyone else. Yes, you'll still make your salary and you'll still run the
company, but it might be a better one for it.
