   I’ve become a much better developer than I was when I began working
   professionally a decade ago. I feel confident enough in my abilities
   to recognize that I have improved the breadth of my skill set and the
   depth of understanding I’ve built in the areas I have poured the most
   focus into over the last few years, especially. One of my strongest,
   most developed abilities is the ability to recognize and pick apart
   my own skills critically. I feel good that I can say this is not
   Impostor Syndrome, something that has certainly afflicted my
   professional career for most of the years I’ve been at this. What
   this is, rather than irrational undervaluing of my skills, is finally
   getting to the point that I realize \ **I’ve spent years getting
   better passively and accidentally, and I need to develop my skills
   into the future actively and intentionally.**

.. container::

   So to start this new focus on developing my skills, I’m writing this
   as a starting point, an exploration, and an invitation to anyone who
   identifies with the intent.

.. container::

   I can characterize the path I took from fledgling to, I believe,
   experienced developer as passive with more accuracy than any other
   single word. Passively developed skill happens when you absorb
   through experience, colleagues, and material that comes your way
   without specific and focused intent on what you’re getting better at.
   I’m better today than I was ten years ago, largely, because it is
   nearly impossible to do what I do for this many years without
   learning something. I can say with confidence that I’m a much better
   developer today, but I cannot say that I had much of a hand in that.

.. container::

   The past ten years of experience were littered with an almost
   obsessive absorption of material from the wider programming
   community. I’ve dozens of programming texts, listened to many
   podcasts, and read what must be thousands and thousands of blog posts
   that simply drifted my way through feeds and social media. With such
   a huge amount of material I’ve sifted through over the years it is
   inevitable to accept a distressing outcome: \ **the majority of
   programming material I’ve consumed has been completely
   forgotten.** There might be a book or two I still remember and can
   recommend, and I can recall and find you a link to maybe ten blog
   posts that actually stick out in memory. There are probably hundreds
   of posts I’ve read from which I’ve integrated some information from.
   I am sure I’ve learned from this flood of programming material, but I
   can’t say the ratio is very impressive. To be honest, I can’t say the
   pay off for the time and effort I put into finding, tracking, and
   consuming all the fascinating things I’d like to learn.

.. container::

   This has also been one of the most useful ways I’ve randomly come
   across ideas and technologies that have changed the course of my
   interests and even my career. I’m distressed over this for two
   reasons. First, I’m pretty sure that I can trace many of the major
   turning points in my career to things I came across entirely by
   accident. Second, there has been awful lot of equally fascinating
   things I’ve encountered and dived into that, today, do not really
   have any value to me as a developer. With a lack of direction \ **I
   have wasted an immeasurable time on interesting development topics
   that I’ve walked away from with nothing of value.** This isn’t
   something I can allow to continue. I don’t have the time or energy to
   continue being so ineffective with my self-improvement as a
   developer.

.. container::

   My new effort is to both spend less time and get more out of my
   self-improvement as a developer. I don’t want to rely on stumbling
   across the important things I need to learn and I don’t want to coast
   through self-improvement as a by-product of habit and the ingrained
   interest in the newest and greatest developments in the field.
   Instead, \ **I want to be an active participant in my own self
   improvement.** I want to rely on actively made plans and goals rather
   than passive habits. This means reading less random posts shared on
   Twitter and found on RSS feeds, and more structured learning and
   practice.

.. container::

   Active self-improvement has to replace the casual accidents of
   discovery.My hope is to replace what is moved me along at a casual
   pace with setting goals to \ **learn things intentionally and making
   hard choices** about not only the next topic, but precisely what I
   want to get out of it.

.. container::

   I’m not sure, yet, exactly what form this change in focus will have.
   I expect I’ll need to figure that on the way, and see what works and
   see what slows me down. I know my more immediate intentional
   improvements will be expanding my knowledge and experience with the
   wider ReactJS ecosystem, but soon it will go beyond that to other
   endeavors.

.. container::

   The thing I can say with confidence is that I expect to feel better
   about the progress I make in the next year than i do about the
   progress I’ve made in the past ten.
