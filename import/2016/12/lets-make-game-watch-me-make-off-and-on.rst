Let's Make A Game! I've been making games to one degree or another for a
few years, and I've really gotten into `a rhythm in the last few
months <http://techblog.ironfroggy.com/2016/12/finding-one-game-month.html>`__.
This month I'm trying a new experiment and posting the entire process of
building the month's game development project. I'll be publishing a
stream of every single step I take in the process, broken down into 25
one hour episodes.
I'm doing this for a few reasons.
Firstly, I'm doing this for myself. The one hour sessions and the focus
recording gives me on the task at hand are helpful. I think this is an
interesting way to go about a project. I'd also like the strict schedule
to help me study and learn more about the aspects of budgeting and
scoping game projects that I have too little experience to be very good
at.
Secondly, I'm hoping someone out there gets some value out of this. My
skill level as a game developer is still pretty low, but maybe its
helpful for someone to see how someone learns to solve problems, rather
than only watching experts that already know the answers.
Thirdly, I want to see if I like the idea and to figure out if I'll keep
doing it. Maybe this will be the only time I do this. Maybe I'll scale
back the number of hours and continue it on a monthly basis or just
occasionally, in the future. Or, also likely, this may be a one time
thing.
