   Off And On Again is a series of light puzzles. You must turn all the
   lights on, but you must do so by flipping them in patterns. If you
   turn one light on or off, you'll be flipping lights around it, too.
   If you can find the right combination, you'll brighten up the board
   and move on to the next challenge.

   This was more than just a game. This was a public project in putting
   light on the hobbyist game development experience. Created over 25
   hours, every single minute of the development of Off And On Again is
   available as part of a YouTube series Let's Make A Game. If you're
   interested in learning from this process and seeing what came out of
   it, you can watch the entire creation of Off And On Again and then
   play the game for yourself.
