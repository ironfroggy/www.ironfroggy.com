<div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;">I was really excited about the <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/">One Game A Month</a> challenge as soon as I heard about it.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;">For about two years I've struggled in fits and starts to make my way into game development. This hasn't been productive in any of the ways I hoped when I started. Its really difficult to be fairly experienced as a developer, which I believe I am in my day job as a web developer, while struggling really hard at an area in which your experience just doesn't exist.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;">Its like being a pilot who doesn't know how to drive.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><!--StartFragment-->               <!--EndFragment--><br /><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;">But this challenge provided a new breath to this little hobby of mine. It gave me a scaffolding to experiment, to learn, to reflect on finished projects. I had spent far too much time on game projects that stretched on far past their exciting phases, bogged down by bad decisions and regret. </div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;">And it has worked.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;">I have a lot to learn. I have a lot of experience to gain through trial and error and mistake and discovery. I have a lot of fun to be had making more small games that scratch the little itches that have been building up. I have a really exciting 2017 planned for game development!</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; margin: 0in;"><a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/ironfroggy">I've been doing One Game A Month</a>&nbsp;for three months now. I've released <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StonebirdGames.Matchlock">three</a> <a href="https://stonebird.itch.io/the-author-and-the-deadline">small</a> <a href="https://stonebird.itch.io/last-stand-of-the-mushroom">games</a>. These aren't great games by any stretch of the definition, of course. But they're games that I'm learning from. They're something I'm really excited about and I have needed something <i>personally exciting</i>&nbsp;as a developer for a long time. These are good times for me, and I hope to have more to share about them soon.</div>
