Let's Make A Game! I've been making games to one degree or another for a few years, and I've really gotten into <a href="http://techblog.ironfroggy.com/2016/12/finding-one-game-month.html">a rhythm in the last few months</a>. This month I'm trying a new experiment and posting the entire process of building the month's game development project. I'll be publishing a stream of every single step I take in the process, broken down into 25 one hour episodes.<br /><br />I'm doing this for a few reasons.<br /><br />Firstly, I'm doing this for myself. The one hour sessions and the focus recording gives me on the task at hand are helpful. I think this is an interesting way to go about a project. I'd also like the strict schedule to help me study and learn more about the aspects of budgeting and scoping game projects that I have too little experience to be very good at.<br /><br />Secondly, I'm hoping someone out there gets some value out of this. My skill level as a game developer is still pretty low, but maybe its helpful for someone to see how someone learns to solve problems, rather than only watching experts that already know the answers.<br /><br />Thirdly, I want to see if I like the idea and to figure out if I'll keep doing it. Maybe this will be the only time I do this. Maybe I'll scale back the number of hours and continue it on a monthly basis or just occasionally, in the future. Or, also likely, this may be a one time thing.<br /><br />If you're interested, check out the Youtube channel for my one-man game studio, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYyErCdIvOxGrO_lvtZFiag">Stonebird Games</a>.<br /><br />You can watch the first three episodes right here!<br /><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jlFKDVs9l3Q" width="560"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sbCKqzoQdQU" width="560"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3Z1bxo5xtA" width="560"></iframe>
