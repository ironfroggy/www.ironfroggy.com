   I was really excited about the `One Game A
   Month <http://www.onegameamonth.com/>`__ challenge as soon as I heard
   about it.

   For about two years I've struggled in fits and starts to make my way
   into game development. This hasn't been productive in any of the ways
   I hoped when I started. Its really difficult to be fairly experienced
   as a developer, which I believe I am in my day job as a web
   developer, while struggling really hard at an area in which your
   experience just doesn't exist.

   Its like being a pilot who doesn't know how to drive.

   But this challenge provided a new breath to this little hobby of
   mine. It gave me a scaffolding to experiment, to learn, to reflect on
   finished projects. I had spent far too much time on game projects
   that stretched on far past their exciting phases, bogged down by bad
   decisions and regret.

   And it has worked.

   I have a lot to learn. I have a lot of experience to gain through
   trial and error and mistake and discovery. I have a lot of fun to be
   had making more small games that scratch the little itches that have
   been building up. I have a really exciting 2017 planned for game
   development!

   `I've been doing One Game A
   Month <http://www.onegameamonth.com/ironfroggy>`__ for three months
   now. I've released
   `three <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StonebirdGames.Matchlock>`__
   `small <https://stonebird.itch.io/the-author-and-the-deadline>`__
   `games <https://stonebird.itch.io/last-stand-of-the-mushroom>`__.
   These aren't great games by any stretch of the definition, of course.
   But they're games that I'm learning from. They're something I'm
   really excited about and I have needed something *personally
   exciting* as a developer for a long time. These are good times for
   me, and I hope to have more to share about them soon.
