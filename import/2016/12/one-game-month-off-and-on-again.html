<div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Off And On Again</span> is a series of light puzzles. You must turn all the lights on, but you must do so by flipping them in patterns. If you turn one light on or off, you'll be flipping lights around it, too. If you can find the right combination, you'll brighten up the board and move on to the next challenge.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">This was more than just a game. This was a public project in putting light on the hobbyist game development experience. Created over 25 hours, every single minute of the development of Off And On Again is available as part of a YouTube series <span style="font-style: italic;">Let's Make A Game</span>. If you're interested in learning from this process and seeing what came out of it, you can watch the entire creation of Off And On Again and then play the game for yourself.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Series: </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlFKDVs9l3Q&amp;list=PLg8XhO9Ilwl9Bw9h5wimuRgx5VrK3D-Kb">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlFKDVs9l3Q&amp;list=PLg8XhO9Ilwl9Bw9h5wimuRgx5VrK3D-Kb</a></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><br /><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Game: </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stonebirdgames.OffAndOnAgain">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stonebirdgames.OffAndOnAgain</a></div>
