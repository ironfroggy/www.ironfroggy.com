      I’m going to take some time out of absolutely loving Evernote for
      keeping me on task and organized throughout the day to talk about
      what, I think, is absolutely the worse thing about it.

   .. container::

      **Evernote is a completely different application on every platform
      and device it supports.**

   .. container::

      For a product who’s main gimmick is keeping you organized and your
      data synced between all of your platforms and devices, that’s sort
      of a really hard knock against them. The Evernote for Windows
      application is great, but so is the Evernote for Mac application.
      These are quite different, and not just in the ways that usual
      differ between Windows and Mac to fit the platforms well. They are
      just fundamentally different applications which coincidentally
      happen to be sharing your data.

      Beyond the two desktop Evernotes, the problem only gets worse.
      Evernote for Android is yet another experience, with yet other
      features different from the two Desktop versions.

   .. container::

      The most jarring differences between these versions are
      differences in the editing of your notes themselves, something
      that (given the nature of the tool) seems like being consistent
      should have been priority number 1. How am I supposed to work on
      my notes everywhere if my notes may be different everywhere?

      Perhaps the most frustrating part of all this comes down to what
      is definitely the most overlooked face of Evernote from their
      development team: Evernote for the Web. This version of the
      product has, by far, the most missing features found at least in
      some form in most of the other versions.

      This Web version being so limited is especially troubling because,
      would it be better supported, the differences of all the other
      versions would barely scratch my notice. I’d just use the web
      version everywhere.

      Moving forward, these discrepancies are killing my loyalty to
      Evernote and I can’t see there is anyway I’ll be able to continue
      as a user much longer. Honestly, I’ve gotten a lot out of it, and
      I’d hoped this situation would improve. That hope is what kept me
      around this long. As it continues to only appear more divergent
      over time, not less, it seems my hope was misplaced.

   .. container::

      I’m still looking for the replacement, but I’m going to find it
      (or make it) and then it’ll be “so long” to Evernote, I’m afraid.
