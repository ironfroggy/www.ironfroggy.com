   Today’s the second day of the first month of this new year. I decided
   to go ahead and do a sort of Fresh Start writing on this new year,
   even though it isn’t strictly the first. It wasn’t by design, but I
   like the laid back attitude of that because its part of my focus. I
   want to look forward to the year and I want to set some goals, but I
   don’t want to set myself up for letting myself down. That’s new years
   resolutions can so often do and I’m not going to do any of them. I’m
   happy to see my wife taking a similar approach because we’re so often
   on the same page.

   I’m going to lay out my thoughts about both this month and this year.
   Maybe the month thing will become a Thing I do more regularly, sort
   of checking in on the directions I’m taking.

      I’ve taken two weeks off for the holiday, so my energy for work is
      at an all time high after such a great break. This is leaning my
      attention right now towards things work related, both officially
      and unofficially as I look at what I need to do when i return to
      work this week, but also the wider focus on my web development
      skills and the areas where I’m most interested in practicing and
      exploring.

      ReactJS has a lot of my attention today and probably will for the
      foreseeable future through January. I intend to do a lot more self
      education on React, Redux, and the best practices that have been
      growing in that ecosystem. I want to use this at work, but I’m
      already sold on it personally so this will be something I explore
      either way. The more I educate myself the better positioned I’ll
      be about introducing it at work. I feel myself becoming a vocal
      advocate about React and I’m totally okay with that.

      As two posts in today can attest to I’m feeling a rise of writing
      energy and directing it. Maybe getting this blog in order is also
      helping that, despite still having over three-hundred posts to
      migrate from the old blog. I don’t know how long the migration
      will take but I won’t waste that time not writing. I don’t know
      how often I’ll post but I’m very determined to write every day.
      I’ve been doing Morning Pages, which I recommend to everyone, and
      hope to do at least one good writing session in addition to those
      every day. My plan is to sit down with a blank screen, fill it
      with words, and repeat that until good things come out I can turn
      into posts. That’s largely where this came from.

      Professionally, I have less specificity and more of a general
      sense of “get better” mostly in organizing. I’ve always
      contradicted myself in my love for organizing that is so starkly
      contrasted by how ill organized I actually am. I’m trying to get
      better at that and expect to make a really solid effort by
      starting my first day back after the break an hour early just to
      sit down, look over all my active projects, and really lay out
      what my plans are for the week. I’ve been trying to build habits
      about how I organize through the day and week, and how I make sure
      nothing slips through the crack. I keep ongoing notes, but don’t
      follow through often enough with moving those into action lists
      and notes on the projects I have on my plate. I think this is a
      good month to push these efforts up notch.

      On a broader scale, I’m not looking at the year of 2016 with a
      definite set of resolutions I’m going to accomplish, but I’m
      taking stock of the things that I feel are important to me right
      now. I think these will change and that’s a good thing. I’ll let
      my focus grow and adapt along with my life.

      I’m going to play more video games, both with my son and on my
      own. We got more games for the Wii-U and we’re having blast. Plus
      he got me a new USB gamepad for my desktop machine and I can’t
      wait to get more into that. I need to rekindle my love of gaming.
      But I want to balance that, because while I feel a need to play
      more games I know my son could probably cut back. I have plenty of
      other interests we share, between reading and creating, but he’s
      become so focused on his video games he needs some help learning
      to follow other passions. I’ve let his focus on creativity wane
      and I don’t want him to struggle with those lacking habits in the
      future, so its a good time to take my own need to create more and
      channel it into family activities that get him sitting away from
      the screen more often.

      I’m going to read more. I’ve been loving the first Nightvale novel
      and I’ve got plenty of books lined up ready to read after it. I’m
      doing better at finding that time and I’m going to keep increasing
      that momentum. The more I read the more I enjoy it, the faster I
      get through books, and the better I get at absorbing each next
      book. I am starting to feel like obtaining my high school levels
      of reading is actually possible.

      I’m going to be more out. This is a hard one to explain to some
      people, but here it is: I’m a queer person that doesn’t fit any
      typical queer person persona. Its hard to feel like a member of
      any queer community as a person who doesn’t outwardly look like a
      queer person. I’m not with any men and I’m happily married to my
      wife of twelve years, together raising our brilliant son we don’t
      look any different than most heterosexual families, when in fact
      neither of us are straight. And while we’re very open about that,
      the fact is that being open about it just doesn’t come up much or
      impact our lives a lot. That inherent lack of impact can make it
      feel like a huge part of who you are as a person just isn’t there,
      or doesn’t count for as much. This is genuinely painful, and
      whether its through activism or otherwise, I hope to find more
      ways to embrace this part of myself.
