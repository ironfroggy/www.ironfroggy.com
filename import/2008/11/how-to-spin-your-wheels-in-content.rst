The week has been giving me little time to write, with lots of things to
run around and do. I'll be waiting on my auto work to get done tomorrow
and have more free time going forward. This blog a day thing has been
difficult to do with any value so far, but I'll make it all average out.
Anyway, I'm cheating today with a preview. This is a list of things I
will absolutely be writing in the coming weeks.
