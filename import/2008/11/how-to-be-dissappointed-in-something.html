I recommend purchasing <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/expert-python-programming/book">Expert Python Programming, by Tarek Ziadé</a>. I am extremely disappointed in this book, but I'm recommending it specifically if you already have a good grasp of Python.<br /><br />You see, I was really looking forward to recommending this book. I had hoped that the many people I know with a good developer head on their shoulders, but had not approached Python with seriousness before, would find this a perfect introduction to sit down with. While I'm really pleased with the writing and structure of the content, I'm afraid this is a book suffering from severe editing oversights. There are subtle mix-ups in terminology in many places and some code samples that are simply and absolutely incorrect.<br /><br />This is where I made my decision:<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'courier new';">>>> from threading import RLock<br />>>> lock = RLock()<br />>>> def synchronized(function):<br />...     def _synchronized(*args, **kwargs):<br />...         lock.acquire()<br />...         try:<br />...             return function(*args, **kwargs)<br />...         finally:<br />...             lock.release()<br />...     return _sychronized<br />>>> @locker<br />... def thread_safe():<br />...     pass<br /></span><br />I'm actually not going to point out the actual two mistakes here (I suspect most people that notice will only notice one of them). I want to demonstrate that the problem can be subtle for someone new, but otherwise with a good understanding of software development. This rendered the text applicable to a much smaller readership than it would have otherwise been perfect. I want to repeat how much I really liked the writing, and that I really am recommending it this book. I simply want to express my simultaneous disappointment. I'm really looking forward to posting a glowing review of a second edition of this book.<br /><br /><br />A closing note...<br /><br />I sat with this book on myself for the last two weeks trying to decide what to do about my decision on it. Honestly, it was a difficult choice to write about it at all. I am certainly not making any friends at Packt.
