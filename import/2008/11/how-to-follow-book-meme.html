This is not a bug.<br /><br />I traced the book meme that is going around back to <a href="http://lodge.glasgownet.com/2008/11/05/a-book-meme/">this guy</a>. My nearest was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Software-Writing-Selected-Introduced/dp/1590595009">The Best Software Writing</a>. Somehow, I really like what this random peek into a book gave me to post. Somehow quite fitting.<br /><br />The rules for this meme thing are :<br /><ul><li>Grab the nearest book.<br /></li><li>Open it to page 56.<br /></li><li>Find the fifth sentence.<br /></li><li>Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.<br /></li><li>Donâ€™t dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.<br /></li></ul>
