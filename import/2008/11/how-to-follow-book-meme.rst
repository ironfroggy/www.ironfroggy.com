| This is not a bug.
| I traced the book meme that is going around back to `this
  guy <http://lodge.glasgownet.com/2008/11/05/a-book-meme/>`__. My
  nearest was `The Best Software
  Writing <http://www.amazon.com/Best-Software-Writing-Selected-Introduced/dp/1590595009>`__.
  Somehow, I really like what this random peek into a book gave me to
  post. Somehow quite fitting.
| The rules for this meme thing are :

-  Grab the nearest book.
-  Open it to page 56.
-  Find the fifth sentence.
-  Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these
   instructions.
-  Donâ€™t dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual
   one: pick the CLOSEST.
