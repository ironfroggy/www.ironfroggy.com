made me shift gears from NaNoWriMo to, obviously, posting once a day
every day this month. Obviously, I missed the first, because I was out
of town. I could have managed it anyway, but the change in plans was
late in the game and I was out late that night. This still gives me a
chance to flex the writing muscles and I'm really happy to take part in
it. Thanks to everyone who has inspired each other to keep this going
this month.

   This is my semi-mandatory and semi-cheating meta-post about the
   month, where I get to say I posted for the day. Really, I'm just
   filling time by writing about the fact that I'm going to be writing.
   To give this emptiness a little meat, I'll say that I have something
   of a schedule. I have a few topics to be covered in some fun posts
   and even somethings to cover in a series of posts. It will be a fun
   month.

   Everyone, keep me honest. Yell at me if I miss a day.
