   I voted.

      Being a geek, I took a keen interest on the touchscreen voting
      machine used in my county. There was a checkbox within the larger
      label for each option. This kept everyone safe from the common
      "finger slip" mistake that has plagued the touchscreen voting
      machines. I also took note of a window along the side, where I
      could watch my votes being recorded on the paper receipts. I feel
      pretty confident most voters will completely ignore this physical
      verification.

      There were some parallels I drew between this and a recent
      interest of mine: touch screen interfaces. Voting machines might
      make us angry every few years, but mobile phones and PDAs annoy us
      each and every day. We're reaching a critical point in the
      cheapness of touchscreen displays, making them the inevitable
      first-class interface. We need to come to some standards and
      practices that give them the consistancy and expectedness that we
      get using our common interfaces today. At the same time, I'm glad
      to see a place where some creativity can happen seriously.
