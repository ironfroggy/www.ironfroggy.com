   Last week, Scott Petersen from Adobe gave a talk at Mozilla on a
   toolchain he’s been creating—soon to be open-sourced—that allows C
   code to be targeted to the Tamarin virtual machine. Aside from being
   a really interesting piece of technology, I thought its implications
   for the web were pretty impressive.

| The next steps Scott took are the most interesting, because he starts
  using this to build stock Python and Ruby runtimes that are hosted on
  Tamarin. This is a fascinating solution to one of our biggest itches:
  more languages on more platforms.
| Imagining the sheer number of languages (most) this opens up to
  running on any Tamarin run-time (Flash and Firefox 4) is mind
  boggling. Go on, let your mind be boggled. Combine this with the basic
  idea being targetted to other platforms and you've got a lot of
  possibilities. Target other bytecode, like Java or .Net, and you open
  up more possible cross-builds than you can count. Platforms begin to
  fade on the borders.
| At the same time, Mozilla is already busy learning to convert DLR
  bytecode to Tamarin bytecode, so I guess Java is the only bytecode
  left anyone (maybe) cares enough about getting to run on it. Down the
  road, could this mean Flash (and Firefox 4) will be the only platform
  supporting, essentially, any and all languages and libraries, in some
  form or another? Impressive.
| Not only would Tamarin support Python, but potentially all major
  implementation of the language. Choices are great.
| Of course, the same will be done for every platform, and once again
  the pattern repeats itself. Vendors will fight over control of the
  platform, just to be made irrelevent by one layer above them.
