Most of the buzz about the App Engine has died down, except among the
developers actually using the platform. When the first public
announcements were made, I was a part of the original group of
developers first given access. This privilege was wasted. I did nothing
with it. This has changed, which is a topic for a different post. I
thought I'd take a moment to make my mark on the "What I think about
Google App Engine" wall.
A proper review is difficult, for a number of reasons. Namely, there is
a very vague understanding of the difference between this "Preview
Release" and what we'll have when it launches with all official status
and commercial potential. We can only hope that any big changes won't
interfere with our existing applications. If that does happen then
existing players might turn to `AppDrop <http://appdrop.com/>`__ for
help, although any mass migration is highly doubtful. In any case, what
everyone is talking about is what App Engine is now, not what it might
turn into at some unknown point. (As a side note, it would be really
great if that point was less unknown!)
What is a review of App Engine really about? Their choice of included
libraries, as well as the promotion of Django templates into such a
defacto standard (already having Guido's blessing) is one thing to talk
about. The differences between BigTable and traditional relational
databases is a big topic of debate. We can discuss the development
server and deployment method, as well as the control panel available to
us, if we want to focus away from the actual programming for a moment.
In the end, what we really need to care about is the thing Google set
out to solve: experience.
They changed the experience in two meanings of the word. A less
experienced developer can now make a successful launch. All developers
can have a much better experience. The experience, both in history and
present, is of the full cycle of development. App Engine isn't doing
anything for writing code. That is all low-bar when you look at the
tools they use that were already available and in wide-use, like Python
and Django. The value added spice of App Engine is what you do when you
aren't writing code.
People complain about the choice of language, if they aren't already
Python lovers. Some people just don't like the choice of included
template system. There are complaints about BigTable in App Engine and
its problems compared to a "normal" database. These debates are all
bunk. People are complaining about the very things that don't matter one
bit. In the end, we might develop a hundred libraries for doing the same
thing, because we all think we know the slightly better way to do it,
but App Engine exposes our primary flaw: we're developers. We're great
at solving problems, building solutions, and writing code. We run out of
steam when it comes to doing something with it. Our problem solving
desire is a largely academic one.
If a software developer solved world hunger, he would blog about it and
move on to the next project.
App Engine would read that post and actually go out and implement the
solution the developer forgot about. It does a great job at what it
solves, and I love using it. What I'm doing with it and why not enough
developers care about it are both stories for other posts.
