| So, the twittersphere is in an uproar about those dropped follower
  counts. Is everyone more afraid of the lost high-count vanity or that
  so many people follow without thought that we might never regain many
  of the legitimate follows? Either way, there is a lot of complaining
  about the apparently service mishap from the company that we shell
  over so none of our hard earned dollars to. The mistake is one thing,
  but I see quite a bit of sentiment against the very method they
  undertook to combat the spam problem. I challenge that claim, because
  I think they're on the right track limiting follows, and I'm going to
  explain why.
| 
  For Popular People This Means...
| You're popular by how many people follow you, not the other way
  around. You can go on your way, with thousands of people hanging on
  your every toilet flush, and Twitter can still limit those damn
  spammers from following you along with ten-thousand other ego filled,
  txt-fingered masters of the twitterverse.
| For "Community Managers" This Means...
| Now, `ReadWriteWeb <http://www.readwriteweb.com/>`__ `makes a
  claim <http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/new_twitter_anti-spam_bot_causes_chaos.php>`__
  that so-called "community managers" are harmed by these changes.
  Examples include `Comcast <http://twitter.com/comcastcares>`__,
  `JetBlue <http://twitter.com/jetblue>`__, and
  `Pandora <http://twitter.com/pandora_radio>`__, who use Twitter to
  keep in touch with their customer base. Now, kudos to some random guy
  at each of these corporations signing up under his employer's name.
  However, a reasonable use case falling under this category of twitter
  account just shouldn't be worried with how many people they can
  follow. Just like the populars, its all about how many people are
  listening to you, because what those peasents have to say doesn't even
  register to you.
| No one is reading closely to a timeline filled by thousands of
  follows!
| For Spammers This Means...
| Don't follow thousands of people when only a couple dozen morons fall
  for your bullshit.
| For Twitter This Means...
| Discourage the need for any legitimate uses of massive follow lists,
  you blue bird lovers. The value of following anyone breaks down soon
  after hitting three digits, so figure out why people are doing that in
  the first place. There is a small set of reasons that are even
  conceivably plausible.
| Heavy twitter users who have migrated over to IM or TXT based usage
  may have discovered a nearly hidden feature about your follow lists:
  it is two tiered. That's right, you have important people and everyone
  else, but this is only revealed if you start to use IM or TXT and
  filter the updates you get, likely to reduce phone charges. I found a
  different usage, because limiting the updates was great, even when I
  have unlimited txt on my plan. When I started using desktop clients
  more often than my phone, I wanted that back. Bring this to the
  forefront and let us have our active follows and our passive follows.
  We should probably only care to see our passive follows on some broad
  timeline, versus our narrow timeline. While you're at it twitter, lets
  make this taggable, but that's a whole other story.
| Aside from this, the only other reason I see is the number of things
  you can't do on twitter without explicitly following someone, or being
  followed by them. Open up direct messages (optionally), even without
  follows. Let us do more without following people. Of course, the
  addition of passive follows, as I mentioned previously, would do just
  as well to fix this.
| The number one benefit these changes would have would come from
  expanding the notification options to ignore the passive follows. That
  is, don't tell me if someone is following me passively, because they
  don't really care about me, so I don't really care about them. They
  can put whatever restrictions they want on active follows, within
  reason, and we can all still keep track of thousands of twitterers,
  without looking like spammers. All you need to do is attack the number
  one reason spammers mass-follow: they're abusing twitter to send plain
  old fashioned e-mail spam, with a very crappy costume.
| In The End
| Summing up with the bold lines:

-  No one is reading closely to a timeline filled by thousands of
   follows!
-  The value of following anyone breaks down soon after hitting three
   digits
-  they're abusing twitter to send plain old fashioned e-mail spam, with
   a very crappy costume

Concluding easily that automated checks and limits on following lots of
people is fine, because only spammers have a real reason to do it.
