This is a follow up to my first `How To Walk Backwards to HTML
5 <http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2007/12/how-to-walk-backwards-to-html-5.html>`__
article. The one comment I got in this first Twenty-Four hours pointed
out a lack of explanation on my part for a few things. I know about the
current HTML 5 specification. I've read most of it, reviewed plans and
others' reactions, etc. My views on HTML 5 are not out of a lacking of
knowledge, but are a reaction to my knowledge of HTML 5.
I think what HTML 5 looks to be shaping into is the wrong direction.
The creation of the layout specific tags is a response to what was
coined "div hell", but it isn't the right solution. We all have
different needs for what we need HTML to represent and it gets abused
into representing everything from resumes to tetris clones. Abandon
schemas and doctypes and just let us write the tags that have meaning
for our cases. Hey, we can do that with XML namespaces! Give us to the
tools to discover formatting and layout rules and control the pages
intelligently.
If you need an article tag, fine. Use it and have fun, but maybe it just
doesn't do anything for me.
The need to post this article was rekindled when my colleagues spent the
better part of twenty minutes debating the default rendering properties
of the paragraph element. Can you imagine when we start adding even more
layout and content specific tags to the new spec? The result is going to
be disastrously inconsistent, because there is just more to be
inconsistent about.
