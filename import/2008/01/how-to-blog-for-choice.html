So I vowed to write more and blog more and the year has plenty of time left in it, so don't worry about me. The past month has been amazing, and that's why I haven't had the time to write. I'll be scheduling it soon, so a resurgence in content is imminent. I try to keep on my tech topic, but I do far too little activism on the things I believe in, and its high time I changed that. Don't worry, politics will not become a staple of this blog, but I'm likely reviving my personal blog. But, no one reads that, so how vocal can I be about something with no readers?<br /><br />Today is Blog for Choice Day<br /><br /><a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/choice-action-center/bfc08-home.html?wt.mc_id=bfc08_taf" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/graphics/bfc_day_button_200.jpg" alt="Blog for Choice Day" height="123" width="200" /></a><br /><br />We're supposed to be a logical bunch. We spend out careers thinking about things and being intelligent. When you think about something long enough, there are obvious realizations that everyone comes to. People that think about tracking version changes all realize you need goof version control. Any group of people trying to coordinate understand the need for issue trackers. Software is designed in chaos, but a small bit of thought leads us all to the same conclusions.<br /><br />Do we reach the same ends outside our industry? Is thought universal? There are a lot of things in the world that people take for granted, and that those who think about for some time come to the same conclusions of that the non-thinkers just don't understand. There is no secret that the more educated a person is, the more likely they are to be atheist. Health conscious members of society are more likely to wander away from the steaks and mix up some soy-shakes.<br /><br />Is it any different with the right for a family to decide when they grow? I can't see the logic and forcing every mistake to live through a strained budget, a broken family, or to drag down the life of an aspiring teenager. Life is a precious miracle and the biggest way we can waste it is to let it find its way in the inopportune spots of the world. We don't do the gift of consciousness any favors by making it deal with a life that didn't have room for it.<br /><br />The wrong-right won't even budge to save the life of a mother that could go on to birth more, healthier children. They think its somehow more humane to bring broken babies into broken familes, and take teenagers who made mistakes out of school instead of giving them a second chance to build a life with a family the right way. They can call choice supporters baby killers, and I have a friend who does just that, but all they support is inhumanely putting babies into doomed lives.<br /><br />Think about it.<br /><br />I was an accident.
