| This is my dream so don't squash it for sounding trivial. This is my
  window to the world, the tools of my job, and the outlet of my
  creativity! I want the Perfect Keyboard and the Perfect Mouse.

-  Operate as NiMH battery chargers when plugged into USB for power
-  Lighted keyboard to type in darker conditions. Must be adjustable
-  Must be configurable to PC and Mac layouts
-  Would be handy to configure to DVORAK layout, as well
-  Retractable USB cables
-  Keyboard functions as USB hub, even wirelessly
-  Scroll ball instead of a scroll wheel. I do love my Mighty Mouse
-  Weights for mouse, with storage in keyboard
-  Trackball (or even a nub) in the keyboard to lean back and browse
   with
-  Splittable keyboard with locking adjustments

| I am going to spend the rest of my life replacing perfectly good
  keyboard and mouse combos if no one solves this simple list of
  requirements.
| The adjustable keyboard is probably the hardest part, combined with
  the other requirements I want fit into it. I'd like to pull the
  keyboard apart at a split, adjust the angle, and lock it into
  positions. The numpad would be handy to detach or just adjust, but it
  doesn't bother me as much.
| I use a cheap Micro Innovations set right now, and they serve me well.
  I use the new slim apple keyboard and a Mighty Mouse at work. Everyone
  else at the office hates the Mighty Mouse, except one girl upstairs
  who I do not know. I have taken my place as maintainer of these holy
  relics, so that I will always have them to love upon.
| Looking at the current market of adjustable keyboards gives my wallet
  a sharp pain in the money fold. Not that I need permission from the
  little lady to make such a purchase, but she's said there is no
  problem. I think she just wants me to bitch a little less about hand
  cramps and joint pain. No trouble in the wrists that would point to
  something serious, so don't worry. I Always use a wrist pad and
  meticuously adjust my keyboard, pad, and chair to keep the arms at the
  best position. I'm a stickler for ergonomics, and its the arms and
  hands that get the bulk of that attention.
| Stay comfortable, people.
| EDIT September 9, 2009 I moved onto a Logitech EX110 set a couple
  months ago and the feet already cracked in half and broke off,
  simultaneously. I am getting by with a flat keyboard for the moment
  and have made the decision to get a Kenesis Freestyle, but I haven't
  decided on the details yet. Has anyone tried these? Can anyone
  recommend good setups with them? Alternatively, can anyone suggest
  other makers of two-part keyboards, maybe even with wireless models?
