This is my dream so don't squash it for sounding trivial. This is my window to the world, the tools of my job, and the outlet of my creativity! I want the Perfect Keyboard and the Perfect Mouse.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.scifi.com/tech/pics/Keyboard-Bag_w.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 400px;" src="http://blog.scifi.com/tech/pics/Keyboard-Bag_w.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><ul><li>Operate as NiMH battery chargers when plugged into USB for power</li><li>Lighted keyboard to type in darker conditions.

I'd like to pull the keyboard apart at a split, adjust the angle, and lock it into positions. The numpad would be handy to detach or just adjust, but it doesn't bother me as much.<br /><br />I use a cheap Micro Innovations set right now, and they serve me well. I use the new slim apple keyboard and a Mighty Mouse at work. Everyone else at the office hates the Mighty Mouse, except one girl upstairs who I do not know. I have taken my place as maintainer of these holy relics, so that I will always have them to love upon.<br /><br />Looking at the current market of adjustable keyboards gives my wallet a sharp pain in the money fold. Not that I <span style="font-style: italic;">need</span> permission from the little lady to make such a purchase, but she's said there is no problem. I think she just wants me to bitch a little less about hand cramps and joint pain. No trouble in the wrists that would point to something serious, so don't worry. I Always use a wrist pad and meticuously adjust my keyboard, pad, and chair to keep the arms at the best position. I'm a stickler for ergonomics, and its the arms and hands that get the bulk of that attention.<br /><br />Stay comfortable, people.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">EDIT</span> September 9, 2009</span> I moved onto a Logitech EX110 set a couple months ago and the feet already cracked in half and broke off, simultaneously. I am getting by with a flat keyboard for the moment and have made the decision to get a Kenesis Freestyle, but I haven't decided on the details yet. Has anyone tried these? Can anyone recommend good setups with them? Alternatively, can anyone suggest other makers of two-part keyboards, maybe even with wireless models?
