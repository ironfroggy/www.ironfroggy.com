This week hasn't been great for my productivity. It has been a series of
days overshadowed by a series of things coming up. Between standing in
line at the DMV, computer issues, and today helping my brother-in-law
with a very sudden move, it feels like typing is an unfamiliar act.
(Unless its on the T-Mobile G1, which I'll be reviewing this weekend.)

   Today, I helped load a seventeen-foot U-HAUL truck, made a few last
   minute stops, drove said truck just over an hour south and helped
   unload it into a storage shed. I've never loaded and unloaded a
   complete truck in one day, in all the several moves I've made over
   the last years. I was always able to stretch them over two days, with
   a nice sleep in the middle. After all that, I had to drive the truck
   back to drop it off. I barely made it. My dear wife hit traffic on
   her way to pick me up, so I sat and I waited. I listened to the
   mechanic at the drop-off location declaring how "North Carolina is
   McCain country," which was informative of him. I enjoyed some Mike
   and Ike candies.

   So finally getting home, eating dinner, and putting my son to sleep,
   I sit down at this familiar, glowing box. What code can I get out
   before its time to call a day? What debugging and planning can I get
   in before the consciousness must be suspended? How do I make use of
   what day I have left?

   I did a lot today, even if I couldn't work today. Sometimes, knowing
   when to quit is the best productivity choice you can make. I'll see
   you in the morning, Internet.
