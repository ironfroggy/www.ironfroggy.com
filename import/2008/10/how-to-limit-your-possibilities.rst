So, this was going to be a post about the Python module, subprocess. I'm
a big fan of subprocess and there are a lot of problems that are easier
to solve by using it. We reduce thirteen distinct facilities into one
class. We reduce a diverse ecosystem of interfaces into one, uniform
interface. The subprocess module is good, both by itself and as a symbol
for what Python stands for. I won't be writing my original post about
subprocess.

   It isn't that subprocess isn't important, or that I don't think I can
   express myself properly, but that it brought up something else I
   should write about right now: What should I write about?

   Is this a blog about software development or is this a blog about
   Python development? Does it need to be only one? I'm looking for my
   direction here. I'm not going to stretch this out, because if I do,
   you won't read it. And truth be told, I want you to read it. I want
   you to enjoy reading what I write. At heart, I am a writer. I take no
   shame in admitting that I love watching my graph in Google Analytics
   rise on every post I make. But, this is also about expressing myself,
   as a developer. And that is no more a Python developer than a
   software developer. I can't abstract everything I write.

   The final answer to what my direction is? I don't have one, and
   that's just fine.
