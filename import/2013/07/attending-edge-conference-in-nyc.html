<article>        <div class="document"><i>Pssst... You're reading this on my <b>old</b> blog. You should update your RSS reader for <a href="http://www.ironfroggy.com/2013/edge-conf/attending">my new one</a>!</i> <br /><br />I've been invited to attend what looks to be an amazing event, Edge Conference.<br /> Edge looked to be a different sort of conference, and I'm excited to see how it works.<br /> <blockquote><em>Edge is about everyone learning from everyone else, so you need to  bring something to teach as well as a desire to learn. Every moment of  the conference will be publicly available afterward.</em></blockquote>I hope that I can bring something to the discussion, and I feel that if I don't try to do so, I'm not getting as much as I could out of this. The format of Edge encourages and depends on it, in fact.<br /> <blockquote><em>We open each hour long session with a ten minute talk. After that,  weâ€™re into the discussion, and we keep it moving fast. We record  everything, on video and in text. Everything is released for free to the  world the moment the event ends.</em></blockquote>While I hope I'll be able to get in my two cents to what is sure to  be a great crowd of brilliant people, I'm really excited about what I  can learn from all of them. There are some people involved that I've  looked up to for a long time, most notably <a class="reference external" href="http://rawkes.com/">Rob Hawks</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://farmdev.com/">Kumar McMillan</a>, and how could I not mention <a class="reference external" href="http://www.paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>?<br /><br /> I'm going to be aborbing a lot, and I'm going to bring it all back  here. I hope to have some thoughts before the conference on the two  topics I'm most interested in discussing: Offline and Responsive Images,  and I can't wait to see how my understanding and opinions on all of the  topics change with the conference.<br /> </div></article>
