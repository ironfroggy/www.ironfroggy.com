<br />I'm actually incredibly nervous. My talk is "Offline-First: an Approach to Modern Web Apps", and in it I'll be talking about dealing with how the assumptions of the web are turned upside-down by the notion of offline web apps, but also how this can help us deal with a host of issues that have plagued us for some time.<br /><br />Come see me speak in Raleigh, NC at the NC State Centennial Campus. The conference runs September 21-22, 2013. I've had a great time at the NCDevCon events the past two years, and I'm looking forward to contributing as a speaker this year!<br /><br />
