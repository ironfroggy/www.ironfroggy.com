   *Pssst... You're reading this on my*\ **old**\ *blog. You should

   I've been invited to attend what looks to be an amazing event, Edge
   Conference.
   Edge looked to be a different sort of conference, and I'm excited to
   see how it works.
      *Edge is about everyone learning from everyone else, so you need
      to bring something to teach as well as a desire to learn. Every
      moment of the conference will be publicly available afterward.*

   I hope that I can bring something to the discussion, and I feel that
   if I don't try to do so, I'm not getting as much as I could out of
   this. The format of Edge encourages and depends on it, in fact.
      *We open each hour long session with a ten minute talk. After
      that, weâ€™re into the discussion, and we keep it moving fast. We
      record everything, on video and in text. Everything is released
      for free to the world the moment the event ends.*

   While I hope I'll be able to get in my two cents to what is sure to
   be a great crowd of brilliant people, I'm really excited about what I
   can learn from all of them. There are some people involved that I've
   looked up to for a long time, most notably `Rob
   Hawks <http://rawkes.com/>`__, `Kumar
   McMillan <http://farmdev.com/>`__, and how could I not mention `Paul
   Irish <http://www.paulirish.com/>`__?
   I'm going to be aborbing a lot, and I'm going to bring it all back
   here. I hope to have some thoughts before the conference on the two
   topics I'm most interested in discussing: Offline and Responsive
   Images, and I can't wait to see how my understanding and opinions on
   all of the topics change with the conference.
