   Plasmid is an in-browser database and I've been working on it for a
   few months, talked to many people about it, and finally reached a
   point where I can release an API stable version.
   There are two main components to Plasmid, developed separately.
   PlasmidJS is the in-browser database, based on the IndexedDB
   specification and supports recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, and
   Internet Explorer. The second component is Plasmid Sync: a backend
   server that allows users to synchronize their in-browser databases
   between machines.
   I'm *really* excited about this and I hope to see what people can do
   with it. There are other projects like this around, most notably the
   excellent PouchDB project, but I think Plasmid has properties that
   make it a better fit for many needs.
