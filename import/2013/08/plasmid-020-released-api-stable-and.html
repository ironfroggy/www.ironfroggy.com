<br /><article>        <div class="document">Plasmid is an in-browser database and I've been working on it for a few months, talked to many people about it, and finally reached a point where I can release an API stable version.<br /><br />There are two main components to Plasmid, developed separately. PlasmidJS is the in-browser database, based on the IndexedDB specification and supports recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. The second component is Plasmid Sync: a backend server that allows users to synchronize their in-browser databases between machines.<br /><br />I'm <em>really</em> excited about this and I hope to see what people can do with it. There are other projects like this around, most notably the excellent PouchDB project, but I think Plasmid has properties that make it a better fit for many needs.<br /><div class="section" id="download"><h1>Download</h1>This release is PlasmidJS 0.2.0 and is available at Github and on the Plasmid GitHub page.<br /><br /><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/plasmidhq/plasmid/releases/tag/v0.2.0">0.2.0 on Github</a><br /><br /><a class="reference external" href="http://plasmidhq.github.com/plasmid/">0.2.0 on the Website</a></div><div class="section" id="jump-right-in"><h1>Jump Right In</h1>If you'd like to jump right in, check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://plasmidhq.github.io/plasmid/plasmidjs.html">Getting Started Guide</a> and then the full <a class="reference external" href="http://plasmidhq.github.io/plasmid/plasmidjs_api.html">PlasmidJS API Documentation</a>.</div></div></article>
