   A post \ `Natural Born
   Programmers <http://programmingisterrible.com/post/63729347372/natural-born-programmers>`__ caught
   my eye the other day. An exerpt is below, but I recommend everyone go
   read the whole post. The idea of the natural born programmer really
   is a tremendously damaging and dangerous idea we need to fight
   against.

      The idea of hereditary legislators is as inconsistent as that of
      hereditary judges, or hereditary juries; and as absurd as an
      hereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wise man; and as

      We had found in our past research that viewing intellectual
      ability as a gift led students to question that ability and lose
      motivation when they encountered setbacks. In contrast, viewing
      intellectual ability as a quality that could be developed led them
      to seek active and effective remedies in the face of difficulties

   This petulant belief that programming ability is a gift, rather than
   a skill, often surfaces as a flimsy rationale for the gender
   imbalance in technology, but actually serves to reinforce the
   problem.
