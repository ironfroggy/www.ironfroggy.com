&nbsp;James Hague wrote a <a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/139.html">great post</a> about the emergent nature of complexity in computers.

In the 1970s there was still a case to be made for operating on binary-coded decimal values, with two digits per byte. What’s the advantage of BCD? Large values can be easily displayed without multi-byte division or multiplication. “ASCII Adjust After Addition,” or AAA, was committed to the x86 hardware and 30+ years later it’s still there, emulated in microcode, in every i7 processor.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">...</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The UNIX&nbsp;</span><code style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #444444; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; outline: none 0px;">ls</code><span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">&nbsp;utility seemed like a good idea at the time. It’s the poster child for the UNIX way: a small tool that does exactly one thing well. Here that thing is to display a list of filenames.

We who claim to value simplicity are the guilty party. See, all those little design decisions actually matter, and there were places where we could have stopped and said “no, don’t do this.” And even if we were lazy and didn’t do the right thing when changes were easy, before there were thousands of users, we still could have gone back and fixed things later. But we didn’t.&nbsp;</span></blockquote>The example of ls is my favorite, but it is the starkest difference between the intended simplicity and the complex nightmare that emerged. We see this pattern over and over again, and at times I'm beginning to think the "UNIX Philosophy" itself is to blame. <b>Our focus on small parts is causing us to miss the forest for the trees.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>Thoughts?
