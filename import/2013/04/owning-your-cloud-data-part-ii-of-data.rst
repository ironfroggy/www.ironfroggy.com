| The most well known, yet still problematic, area of data ownership in
  our web-based world is all the data we keep housed "in the cloud" in
  the machines of the services we use every day.

-  The contents of your blog at Tumblr
-  The documents your company shares on Google Drive
-  Your to-do list at Nozbe or Remember the Milk
-  The music you've bought and listen to at Amazon
-  All your family photos kept safely (you hope) on Flickr

| All of these services hold the information that is important to you,
  that you depend on, in many cases defines a large part of who you are
  (your writings, your photos, your musical tastes). How often do you
  plan for these services having a major outage? Or vanishing entirely
  and forever? Or suffering some kind of terrible data loss?
