What does it mean to "own" my data in a web-based world? I don't know
what this means, but we should.
Before the growing responsibilities of "The Web" is for us, owning my
data meant the files sat on my own machine. It meant the files were in a
format that was either human readable, or documented well enough that
alternative tools could read it or convert it. It meant no vendor could
die, or change its mind, and make my data useless to me.
This isn't the case in the web today.
