I ran a conference.
I said it had to be done, apparently I said I'd even be the one to do
it. Before I knew it, I was doing it and now its over.

All the way up to the date of our inaugural year I was feeling
unprepared, afraid I was forgetting terribly important things, or simply
that the event would be uneventful. I could not have been more
unprepared for the sheer success of PyCarolinas, from the presentations
everyone was able to enjoy to the success of the food and drinks we
provided to keep them all going to the amazing sense of community and
connectedness everyone at the conference obviously felt.

   This was not only the first conference I ran, but the first
   involvement in running an event beyond a dozen-person hacknight
   for \ `TriZPUG <http://trizpug.org/>`__, so "out of my comfort zone"
   accurately describes how I felt during the months leading up to
   October 20th and 21st.
   I had mentioned a few times, in a few places, that the carolinas (and
   the south east in general) need a Python conference. What I meant was
   "Hey, *someone else* should run a Python conference, so I can
   attend."
   But, no one did.
   The catalyst was \ `Chris
   Calloway <http://trizpug.org/Members/cbc/>`__ finding the great space
   we used, and pushing to reserve it for the event. Once he had those
   wheels moving, it was up to me to make something happen at the time
   and place we now found ourselves with.

   I did the best I could with no idea what I was doing.
   We did a lot of things right on our first year, which is great.

   -  There was coffee to spare. It was \ *good* coffee
   -  There were pastries and muffins all day long
   -  The schedule and talk selection was well varied and interesting
   -  Food trucks were picked to keep lunch costs down (catering is
      expensive)
   -  We had amazing shirts designed by \ `Julia
      Elman <http://juliaelman.com/>`__ of `Caktus
      Group <http://caktusgroup.com/>`__, one of our sponsors

   The call for proposals was out pretty early, which I think was good.
   Lots of our speakers were able to practice their talks to polish, and
   this really showed.
   I could not have done this alone, and I need to thank everyone who
   made PyCarolinas 2012 possible.
   `Chris Calloway <http://trizpug.org/Members/cbc/>`__ was invaluable.
      He kicked off everything with a space to actually have this event.
      Chris spent countless hours negotiating with the UNC departments
      responsible for our needs between the space of the conference and
      the parking lot we reserved for our lunch trucks. Chris has long
      been the heart of our local user group, TriZPUG, and he carried
      that enthusiasm and commitment to his help in making PyCarolinas a
      reality.
      Thank you, Chris.

   `Kurt Grandis <http://kurtgrandis.com/blog/>`__ was tireless.
      The great lunches we had from the Only Burger truck were possible
      because of all the leg work Kurt did hunting down great options.
      The crowd was really happy about the food truck, and everyone
      should thank Kurt for the great good.
      Thank you, Kurt.

   Rebecca Lovewell was generous.
      She organized our well received coffee reserves, which never ran
      out, and helped underwriting our never ending pastries. Every
      conference I've been to seems plagued with ran-out-of-coffee
      syndrome, so we should all thank her for helping us all stay awake
      through the exhausting weekend.
      Thank you, Rebecca.

   Andrew Thompson was a life saver.
      I made the grave mistake of failing to organize volunteers well,
      or at all, during the actual conference. I also underestimated the
      quick pace and difficulty of keeping up with registration in the
      first morning! But, Andrew stepped in (we had never met before)
      and helped run the registration table, doing a much better job of
      it than I was. Without his spontaneous volunteering, I would have
      been unable to leave registration and take care of everything else
      that needed attending that morning.
      Thank you, Andrew.

   Of course, \ `our
   sponsors <http://blog.pycarolinas.org/sponsors/>`__ made everything
   possible.
      Thank you, \ `Caktus Group <http://caktusgroup.com/>`__.
      Thank you, \ `Google <http://google.com/>`__.
      Thank you, \ `10 Gen <http://10gen.com/>`__.
      Thank you, \ `Marakana <http://marakana.com/>`__.
      Thank you, \ `Cox Media <http://cmgdigital.com/>`__.
      Thank you, \ `Wingware <http://wingware.com/>`__.
      Thank you, \ `Kitware <http://kitware.com/>`__.
      Thank you, \ `Meta Metrics <http://metametricsinc.com/>`__.
      Thank you, \ `RochApps <http://rochapps.com/>`__.
      Thank you, \ `Heroku <http://heroku.com/>`__.
      Thank you, \ `Red Hat <http://redhat.com/>`__.
      And, a special thanks to Joe Copp and Andrew Kuchling, who both
      made personal donations in support of our fledgeling event.

   And, without our amazing speakers to fill our schedule and share
   their knowledge and experiences with us, there would be no conference
   to attend in the first place.
      Thank you, to our keynote speakers Lynn Root and Gary Bishop.
      Thank you to all of all session speakers Randall Hunt, Joseph S.
      Tate, A.M Kuchling, Chris Church, Paul J Kowalczyk, PhD, Rick
      Copeland, Mark Lavin, Michael Manfre, David Ray, Vinod Kurup,
      Wayne Witzel III, William Sams, Al Snow, Barry Peddycord III,
      Kenneth Reitz, Matthew Frazier, Julia Elman, Fred Alger, Jeff
      Heard, Brian Painter, Tim Hopper, Simeon Franklin, Francois Dion,
      Flaviu Simihaian, Chris Calloway, Michael DeHaan, Dr. Brian J.
      Soher, Philip Semanchuk, and Brad Crittenden.

   But, what would a conference be without an audience?
      I want to give a very sincere thank you to everyone who attended
      this first year. You all came to an event that had never happened
      before, so you had no idea what to expect. This faith in our new
      occurance is not missed, and I hope we have lived up to whatever
      it was you hoped to get out of the weekend. I hope that
      PyCarolinas was good enough use of your time that I will not only
      see each and every face again next year, but that you'll all spend
      the year pumping up your local user groups and Python community
      and bring more people along next year.

   There will be a next year. It will be smoother.
   While the first PyCarolinas was amazing, it is important to remember
   what could be done better. I've kept a "to done" list. A list of
   things I \ *should* have done, or done different.

   -  Seek out volunteers for the registration desk ahead of time
   -  Seek out session chair volunteers
   -  Seek out volunteers to clean-up afterwards
   -  Print out better programs with sponsor logos. They deserved more
      thanks.
   -  Prepare the badges and sign-in sheet better. I forgot to
      alphabetize.
   -  The badges should show last names better
   -  and, they should have shown the conference name and logo!

   and, finally
      Even though I talked to the people responsible for the space we
      used about scheduling the cameras to record \ **I should have
      confirmed this within the week before the conference**, in case
      there was a mixup. Which, I am very sorry to report, there was.
      We \ **do not** have the recordings of all our wonderful talks, as
      had been expected. I am terribly sorry for this.
      Not the least of reasons being that I didn't actually see any
      talks in full the entire weekend, personally.

   If anyone has any other suggestions, please let me know what could
   have been better!
   Thank you to everyone who attended. Thank you again to all our
   sponsors and speakers. I hope to see everyone there again next year!
