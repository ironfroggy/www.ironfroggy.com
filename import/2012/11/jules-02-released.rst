| I've released version 0.2 of Jules today, which is actually the first
  packaged version released. There are no users other than me, so no
  care was taken in backwards compatibility and this is less announcing
  a new verison and more an announcement of the project as a whole.
| Jules is a static blog generator named after a victorian-ish era
  literary or intellectual character, because that's a trendy thing to
  do. (Jekyl, Hyde, Nikola, etc.)
| The design is flexible and plugin-oriented. Much of the built-in
  functionality is available through a set of plugins, which creates an
  architecture very prone to adaptation and customization. One of the
  major goals (though not yet reached) is template impartiality.
| Today, Jules is a very capable little static website generator you may
  find useful for your personal, project, or organization site.
| You can install Jules easily with

.. code:: code

   Â 

.. code:: code

   pip install jules

| 
| Which will install the latest version `from
  PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jules>`__.
