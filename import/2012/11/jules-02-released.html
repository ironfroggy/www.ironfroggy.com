There are no users other than me, so no care was taken in backwards compatibility and this is less announcing a new verison and more an announcement of the project as a whole.<br /><br /> Jules is a static blog generator named after a victorian-ish era literary or intellectual character, because that's a trendy thing to do. (Jekyl, Hyde, Nikola, etc.)<br /> <br />The design is flexible and plugin-oriented. Much of the built-in functionality is available through a set of plugins, which creates an architecture very prone to adaptation and customization. One of the major goals (though not yet reached) is template impartiality.<br /> <br />Today, Jules is a very capable little static website generator you may find useful for your personal, project, or organization site.<br /> <br />You can install Jules easily with<br /> <pre class="code bash literal-block">&nbsp;</pre><pre class="code bash literal-block">pip install jules<br /></pre><br />Which will install the latest version <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jules">from PyPI</a>.
