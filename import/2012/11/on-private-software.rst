Private software is software one writes only for themselves and never
shares or intends to share. It isn't commercial, because it isn't sold
or even distributed at all. It isn't open source, but it shares
something in spirit. I write about this in favor, though like all
things, on a case by caes basis.
I'm coming to really enjoy the idea of private software. Private
software made by a person to solve a personal need and none other. It
is, at its surface, very contrary to what you might expect Open Source
to be about, but in a way I believe it to be a great shining example of
the ideals open source comes from.
