We have wide monitors and our reading doesn't tend to like wide text
very well. This is why newspapers have lots of narrow columns, rather
than stretch each story across the entire width of the paper.
Not all websites follow this tip, so drag this to your bookmark toolbar
and squeeze the margin in 100px at a time, until you can read more
naturally.

.. container::

   `>squeeze!< <javascript:(function()%7Bvar%20s=document.body.style;s.marginRight=parseInt(s.marginRight%7C%7C0)+100+'px';%7D)();>`__

Yes, I could resize my window, but the same width isn't right for all
pages, and most are padded or have sidebars. This is good when you only
need *some* of the pages you have open to be narrower than the rest.
