I think it is worth a new release to announce that I have documented
straight.plugin and published the docs to ReadTheDocs. I hope this will
help anyone who has had trouble parsing my terse README file, and will
improve adoption of the project in the future.
Check out the `new
code <https://github.com/ironfroggy/straight.plugin>`__ and the `new
docs <http://straightplugin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`__.
