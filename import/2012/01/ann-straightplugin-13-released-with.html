<data:post.title></data:post.title><br />I think it is worth a new release to announce that I have documented straight.plugin and published the docs to ReadTheDocs. I hope this will help anyone who has had trouble parsing my terse README file, and will improve adoption of the project in the future.<br /><br />Check out the <a href="https://github.com/ironfroggy/straight.plugin">new code</a> and the <a href="http://straightplugin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">new docs</a>.
