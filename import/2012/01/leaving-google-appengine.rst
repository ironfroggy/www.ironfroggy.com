      I can use AWS and work on technological engineering issues, or
      appengine and work on price-ological engineering issues. :-/

   Maybe I should take myself seriously when I said this. In the past
   few months, I've barely done any feature or bug work on JournaApp,
   because it takes my limited time and energy just keeping myself under
   quota when I'm the *only* *user of the app*. I can't keep that up and
   keep my sanity, and it is honestly an emotionally draining exercise.
   This is creating a toxin that affects everything I do, so I'm going
   to take it out of my life.

   I don't know if I'll port JournalApp or not. I like it, it has been
   fun and useful, but I'll probably take project notes in Evernote from
   here on forward, and on paper again. I miss paper.
