| PyCon 2013 will be my third PyCon, and I'm walking into it with a
  better idea what I'm hoping for than my first two. Here is my
  shortlist for talk hopes.

-  Python inside Government
   Are any federal, state, or local governments using Python internally?
   In any important or large ways? Maybe at the national archives or the
   library of congress? I want to know about these things! Does the IRS
   crunch my taxes with Python?
-  Python and Big Data
   Working with large datasets fascinates me, probably because I don't
   get the opportunity to do so. I'd love to see where Python is being
   used to crunch big datasets. I wonder if gets used in any pipelines
   in processing results from CERN? Or maybe diagnosing medical tests?
-  Python close to the wire, embedded or working with wire protocols
   Using Python in mobile devices, embedded devices, or implementing
   binary protocols on the wire that need to work fast and with low
   latency? These are things people often don't think Python does well,
   so prove them wrong.
-  Python in movies
   Pixar, Disney, I know you guys are out there! Is python used in
   stages of the pipeline to make all those 3D movies I take my kids to
   see?
-  Community-centric talks, please!
   These are personally interesting to me, because I want to build
   community. I want to learn from more people who are great at it.

If you can give any of these talks, or any talk at all, `submit your
proposal <https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp/>`__ for PyCon 2013!
