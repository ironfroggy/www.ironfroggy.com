PyCon 2013 will be my third PyCon, and I'm walking into it with a better idea what I'm hoping for than my first two. Here is my shortlist for talk hopes.<br /><br /><ul><li>Python inside Government<br />Are any federal, state, or local governments using Python internally? In any important or large ways? Maybe at the national archives or the library of congress? I want to know about these things! Does the IRS crunch my taxes with Python?<br /><br /> </li><li>Python and Big Data<br />Working with large datasets fascinates me, probably because I don't get the opportunity to do so. I'd love to see where Python is being used to crunch big datasets. I wonder if gets used in any pipelines in processing results from CERN? Or maybe diagnosing medical tests?<br /></li><li>Python close to the wire, embedded or working with wire protocols<br />Using Python in mobile devices, embedded devices, or implementing binary protocols on the wire that need to work fast and with low latency? These are things people often don't think Python does well, so prove them wrong.<br /></li><li>Python in movies<br />Pixar, Disney, I know you guys are out there! Is python used in stages of the pipeline to make all those 3D movies I take my kids to see?<br /></li><li>Community-centric talks, please!<br />These are personally interesting to me, because I want to build community. I want to learn from more people who are great at it.</li></ul>If you can give any of these talks, or any talk at all, <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp/">submit your proposal</a> for PyCon 2013!
