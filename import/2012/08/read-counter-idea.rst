   Just a thought. We have so many tools for, essentially, ranking
   content.
   We vote on Reddit, like on facebook, plus one on Google. We pretend
   this stuff is (relatively) new, but aren't they all just non-passive
   hit counters? Maybe a return to the beginnings would be nice. But,
   simply loading a page isn't enough.
   My proposal: the Read Counter.
   At the end of a page, the Read Counter would trigger simply by
   scrolling into view. It would be a rough measurement of traffic, and
   as a simple bonus would avoid counting people who opened the page but
   don't seem to have actually read the content.
   Simple, but useful. Passive, but meaningful.
