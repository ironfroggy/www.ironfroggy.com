<article>        <div class="document"><i><a href="http://www.ironfroggy.com/ideas/read-counter">Originally posted</a> to my new website, where all of this content will eventually go.</i> <br /><br />Just a thought. We have so many tools for, essentially, ranking content.<br /><br /> We vote on Reddit, like on facebook, plus one on Google. We pretend this stuff is (relatively) new, but aren't they all just non-passive hit counters? Maybe a return to the beginnings would be nice. But, simply loading a page isn't enough.<br /> <br />My proposal: the Read Counter.<br /> <br />At the end of a page, the Read Counter would trigger simply by scrolling into view. It would be a rough measurement of traffic, and as a simple bonus would avoid counting people who opened the page but don't seem to have actually read the content.<br /> <br />Simple, but useful. Passive, but meaningful.<br /> </div></article>
