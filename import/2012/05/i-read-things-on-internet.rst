It is true, from time to time I read things on the internet. What has
been bothering me lately is the feeling that all of these ideas I'm
consuming and all of my responses to them are just lost into a sea
churning together everything into the unidentifiable paste that comes
out of my head.
So, I've decided to start logging this. After all, the word "blog" is a
shortening of "weblog", a *web log*, a log of the things you've read on
the web. I want this for my own daily readings, both to keep a record
for myself (and anyone with an interest) and to note my thoughts,
comments, responses, and questions about the things I come across.
`Ironfroggy Reads Things On The
Internet <http://ironfroggy-reads.tumblr.com/>`__ is this new thing. It
is a blog on Tumblr, which I find a useful tool for smaller posts and
their bookmarklet is perfect for my needs here. I'll be directing the
posts to twitter to, as an experiment. Let me know if that turns out
annoying.
Follow it, if you care to. Mostly its for me, but I believe in
transparency by default.
