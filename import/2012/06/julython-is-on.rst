I'm participating in `Julython <http://julython.org/>`__, are you?
Julython is a great initiative to promote Python developers focusing on
their own projects through the month of July and contributing to the
community providing great software, great libraries, and great tools.
Sign up, track your commits on GitHub and BitBucket, and tell your dev
friends to take part.
Julython is going to be a lot of fun!
