    This is my website. I don't know why I felt I should have one. I have a few blogs, both
    public and anonymous. I have tumblr accounts for sharing things I find interesting and
    my programming blog with a fairly good following. I suppose I still feel like I should
    a place online that really belongs to me. It is a little silly, but until I had this I
    felt pretty uneasy writing anything. Where was it going? Who am I trusting with my content?

    At least it is fun to tinker on.
