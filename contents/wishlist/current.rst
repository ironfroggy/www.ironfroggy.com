My wishlist evolves
###################

This is the list of things I hope will happen.

Python 3.4
^^^^^^^^^^

* Python 3.4 will include a good base for asyncronous IO and events, and libraries like Twisted will sit on top of it.

* Python 3.4 will include distribute and pip, and Python packaging will be part of the language.


Firefox
^^^^^^^

* Will gain the ability to move tabs between devices through Sync, not just to *copy* them.
