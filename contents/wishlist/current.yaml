notes: |
    What I really want here is a thing where I can do a series of posts, and each post also changes
    the current list. How would that work? I could have each post be either the addition of one or
    removal of one from teh list. Maybe they shouldn't be posts, necessarily.

    How should this look and how would it work in Jules? Might take some thinking over a little time.

    One obvious way would be to do something like wishlist/wish-NNN.rst and somehow wishlist.yaml
    tells Jules to look for these and compile them into a list. It could use collections, somehow,
    to group them and render them inot the page, just like tags or series pages, only they wouldn't,
    themselves, render their own pages. Or, maybe they could, optionally?

    Then, changes to the wishlist could be compiled into posts, which would just show the changes
    that got made. I would start a branch, edit the items in the list, and then actually do script
    to compare the current and the branch and compile a change post. Alternatively, I could just
    have each change to these items, as posts, show up in the feed.

    How do i want to handle updates in feeds? That is, I guess, also important.

    Let's say I write a post, then a yearr later it has a new version, because the facts changed.
    There should be revision numbers added later.
