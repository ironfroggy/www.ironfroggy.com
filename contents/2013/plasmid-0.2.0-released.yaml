    Plasmid is an in-browser database and I've been working on it for a few months, talked
    to many people about it, and finally reached a point where I can release an API stable
    version.

    There are two main components to Plasmid, developed separately. PlasmidJS is the in-browser
    database, based on the IndexedDB specification and supports recent versions of Chrome,
    Firefox, and Internet Explorer. The second component is Plasmid Sync: a backend server
    that allows users to synchronize their in-browser databases between machines.

    I'm *really* excited about this and I hope to see what people can do with it. There are
    other projects like this around, most notably the excellent PouchDB project, but I think
    Plasmid has properties that make it a better fit for many needs.
