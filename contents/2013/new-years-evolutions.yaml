    I thought about having a new years resolution, but I decided against it. I thought about starting some 365 day project, but I decided against that, too. I've realized that I need to optimize for minimally impacting failure. A year long daily project, like writing 1000 words a day or a short story every day, means that at any point in the year the entire project can "fail". This creates a negative. A demotivational aspect. Something to feel bad about. Motivating structures should create motivation, not destroy it. So, instead of a New Year's resolution, I want to focus (not just this year, but ongoing) on small, focused personal projects and improvements. They can start and stop whenever I decide, and some times I'll determine when they'll end and other times I'll just see how long they go. Some of these will be experiments in self quantification. Others will be personal changes or developments, or creative projects. Some of them will go the way I want and others will not, but I'll learn from all of them. I do not have a New Year's resolution, but my new year will be filled with evolutions.

    While I don't have New Years resolutions I do have "things I want to do (more of)" and "things I want to do less of". These are important, but not because it is a different year. They are on going and should always be worked on.

    I want to write more. I want to draw more. I want to spend less time on the computer when my son is awake. I want to watch less TV. I want to play more board games and card games. I want to more honest with myself. I want to practice my guitar. I want to finish projects. I want to clean up my office and my workroom. I want to use my workroom! I want to be more active in the HTML5/Javascript community. I want to be more social. I want to have more friends. I want to have any friends.
