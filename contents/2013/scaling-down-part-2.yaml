    I'm sticking with the netbook. It took longer to make this decision than I expected,
    but I'm sure of it now.

    What really works better are the subtle things. I grab my netbook quicker and with less
    thought. It weighs lses, I don't think much of carrying it to the car or upstairs. I just
    have it handy and ready more often.

    I'm ready to sell the Thinkpad T510 that has served me well all these years.
