    I'm actually incredibly nervous. My talk is "Offline-First: an Approach to Modern Web Apps",
    and in it I'll be talking about dealing with how the assumptions of the web are turned
    upside-down by the notion of offline web apps, but also how this can help us deal with a
    host of issues that have plagued us for some time.

    Come see me speak in Raleigh, NC at the NC State Centennial Campus. The conference runs
    September 21-22, 2013. I've had a great time at the NCDevCon events the past two years, and
    I'm looking forward to contributing as a speaker this year!
