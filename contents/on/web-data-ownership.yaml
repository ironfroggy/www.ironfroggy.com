title: Data Ownership on the Web
content: |
    This is a big, important topic. I've been thinking about it, and working on plans to deal
    with it, for a while now. Please, tell me what you thnik.

    The web has evolved a lot, both technically and otherwise. It has evolved in how it
    solves problems and what problems it solves to aim. It has evolved both what it is and
    why it is.

    I'll be writing for a while on the subject, in chunks. This is kind of an experiment in my
    ongoing hunt for a better way to write and get my ideas out. Tell me if you think this is
    a good idea, or complain if it just annoys you.
