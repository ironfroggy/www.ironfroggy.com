title: Data Ownership on the Web
content: |
    This is a big, important topic. I've been thinking about it, and working on plans to deal
    with it, for a while now. Please, tell me what you thnik.

    The web has evolved a lot, both technically and otherwise. It has evolved in how it
    solves problems and what problems it solves to aim. It has evolved both what it is and
    why it is.
