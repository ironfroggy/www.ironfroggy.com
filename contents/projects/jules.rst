This website is powered by Jules, a static website generator I wrote when I
was continually frustrated by small and mostly minor nits I had against all
the other options, all of which are very good at what they do.

Jules is a bit more general and designed largely to reduce my constant fear
of being locked into decisions I later regret. It is very adaptable and in
the future entire components and formats could be swapped out and migrated
between, allowing my indecisive nature to flurish.
