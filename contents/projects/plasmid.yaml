    Plasmid is a browser database for offline-first web apps.

    Plasmid makes it easy to take advantage of storage browsers provide for our web applications today.

    Building offline first web apps is a breeze with Plasmid.js, the javascript library that makes the complicated details of IndexedDB under the hood and makes it easy to build, utilize, and manage your browser-side databases.

    But, users don't live on one device and the web thrives online. That's why Plasmid was built from the ground up to support synroncizing these databases with the Plasmid Sync server.

    I am actively developing and using Plasmid and welcome anyone to try it out! I keep a mailing list for the project hosted at Google Groups:

    And don't forget the Plasmid website:
