content: "Just a thought. We have so many tools for, essentially, ranking content.\
  \ \n\nWe vote on Reddit, like on facebook, plus one on Google. We pretend this\n\
  stuff is (relatively) new, but aren't they all just non-passive hit counters?\n\
  Maybe a return to the beginnings would be nice. But, simply loading a page\nisn't\
  \ enough.\n\nMy proposal: the Read Counter.\n\nAt the end of a page, the Read Counter\
  \ would trigger simply by scrolling\ninto view. It would be a rough measurement\
  \ of traffic, and as a simple\nbonus would avoid counting people who opened the\
  \ page but don't seem to\nhave actually read the content.\n\nSimple, but useful.\
  \ Passive, but meaningful.\n"
